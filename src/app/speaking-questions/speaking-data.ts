  dreams: [
    {
      question: "Can you remember the dreams you had?",
      answer: "It really varies – some dreams I remember <u>vividly</u> while others <u>fade away</u> within moments of waking up. I tend to recall dreams better when they're particularly <u>unusual or emotional</u>. I've noticed that if I <u>wake up naturally</u> rather than to an alarm, I'm more likely to remember what I was dreaming about. Some <u>recurring dreams</u> have stayed with me for years – like one where I'm flying over familiar places, which I find quite <u>exhilarating</u>. I've started keeping a <u>dream journal</u> by my bedside, and jotting down dreams immediately upon waking has helped me <u>retain</u> them better. It's fascinating how the mind creates these <u>elaborate narratives</u> while we sleep."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you share your dreams with others?",
      answer: "Yes, I do sometimes, especially when I have a particularly <u>interesting or bizarre</u> dream. I often share them with close friends or family over breakfast or casual conversations. It can be quite <u>entertaining</u> to describe a strange dream and see their reactions. My friends and I sometimes <u>analyze each other's dreams</u> for fun, trying to figure out what might have <u>triggered</u> them. However, I'm <u>selective about</u> which dreams I share – some feel too personal or <u>nonsensical</u> to explain. I find that sharing dreams can actually be a good <u>conversation starter</u> and helps you <u>bond with others</u> over shared human experiences."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you think dreams have special meanings?",
      answer: "That's a fascinating question that I've <u>pondered</u> many times. I believe dreams can have <u>psychological significance</u>, even if not in a mystical sense. They often seem to reflect our <u>subconscious thoughts</u>, worries, or desires that we might not fully acknowledge when awake. For example, dreaming about being unprepared for an exam usually indicates <u>underlying anxiety</u> about something in life. However, I'm <u>skeptical of</u> the idea that dreams can predict the future or have universal symbolic meanings. I think they're more about our brain <u>processing emotions</u> and experiences. That said, I understand why many cultures throughout history have <u>attached great importance</u> to dreams – they do feel <u>mysterious and profound</u>."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you want to make your dreams come true?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Though I think this question refers to <u>aspirations</u> rather than sleeping dreams. I have several dreams I'm actively <u>working towards</u> – like advancing in my career, traveling to certain countries, and eventually owning my own home. I believe having dreams gives us <u>direction and motivation</u> in life. Of course, some dreams are more <u>realistic</u> than others, and I try to set <u>achievable goals</u> that move me closer to my bigger aspirations. I've learned that making dreams come true requires <u>persistence, planning, and patience</u>. It's not just about wishing; it's about taking <u>concrete steps</u> every day. Even if I don't achieve everything I dream of, the <u>pursuit itself</u> is <u>fulfilling and meaningful</u>."

  sportsTeam: [
    {
      question: "Have you ever been part of a sports team?",
      answer: "Yes, I have! During my school years, I was a member of the basketball team for about three years. It was a <u>formative experience</u> that taught me so much about <u>teamwork and discipline</u>. We trained twice a week after school and participated in <u>inter-school competitions</u>. I wasn't the star player by any means, but I <u>contributed to</u> the team and really enjoyed the <u>camaraderie</u> with my teammates. Being part of a sports team helped me develop important skills like communication, <u>handling pressure</u>, and <u>dealing with</u> both victory and defeat gracefully. Even though I'm not on a team anymore, those lessons have <u>stayed with me</u> and apply to many areas of life."
    },
    {
      question: "Are team sports popular in your culture?",
      answer: "Yes, team sports are extremely popular in my country. Football is probably the most <u>widely followed</u> sport – people are incredibly passionate about it and support their local and national teams with great <u>enthusiasm</u>. Basketball and volleyball are also quite popular, especially among younger people. Team sports are often played in schools as part of <u>physical education</u>, and many communities have <u>amateur leagues</u> for various age groups. There's also a strong culture of watching team sports together – families and friends gather to watch important matches, and it becomes a <u>social event</u>. I think team sports <u>resonate with</u> our cultural values of <u>community and collective effort</u>."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you like watching team games? Why?",
      answer: "Yes, I really enjoy watching team games! There's something incredibly <u>exciting and engaging</u> about them. I love the <u>unpredictability</u> – you never know how a game will unfold, and there can be <u>dramatic turnarounds</u> right until the final whistle. Watching skilled players <u>coordinate their movements</u> and execute strategies together is quite impressive. I also enjoy the <u>social aspect</u> of watching games with friends or family; the shared <u>excitement and tension</u> create memorable experiences. The atmosphere in stadiums or even in a living room during a big match is <u>electric</u>. Beyond entertainment, I appreciate the <u>tactical elements</u> – analyzing team formations and strategies adds another layer of interest for me."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the differences between team sports and individual sports?",
      answer: "There are several <u>key distinctions</u> between the two. In team sports, success depends on <u>collaboration and coordination</u> among multiple players, while individual sports rely entirely on one person's performance. Team sports teach you to <u>communicate effectively</u>, <u>trust others</u>, and sometimes <u>sacrifice personal glory</u> for the team's benefit. Individual sports, on the other hand, develop <u>self-reliance</u> and personal accountability – there's no one else to blame or share credit with. The pressure is also different; in team sports, responsibility is <u>distributed</u>, whereas individual athletes bear the full weight alone. Both types <u>cultivate discipline</u> and competitive spirit, but team sports particularly build <u>interpersonal skills</u> while individual sports may foster greater <u>mental toughness</u> and independence."

  petsAndAnimals: [
    {
      question: "What's your favourite animal? Why?",
      answer: "My favourite animal would have to be dogs. I've always been <u>drawn to</u> their <u>loyal and affectionate nature</u>. What I love most about dogs is their <u>unconditional love</u> and the way they can <u>sense your emotions</u> – they seem to know when you need comfort and are always there for you. They're also incredibly <u>diverse</u> in terms of breeds, sizes, and personalities, so there's truly a dog for everyone. I admire their <u>enthusiasm for life</u> – the way they get excited about simple things like walks or treats is quite <u>endearing</u>. Dogs have been <u>companions to humans</u> for thousands of years, and I think there's a good reason for that special bond. They bring so much <u>joy and positivity</u> into people's lives."
    },
    {
      question: "Where do you prefer to keep your pet, indoors or outdoors?",
      answer: "I believe it depends on the type of pet and living situation, but generally, I prefer keeping pets <u>primarily indoors</u> with regular outdoor time. For dogs, I think a combination works best – they should live inside as part of the family but have plenty of opportunities to go outside for walks, exercise, and <u>exploration</u>. Keeping pets indoors ensures they're <u>safe from hazards</u> like traffic, extreme weather, and other animals. It also allows for closer <u>bonding</u> and makes it easier to <u>monitor their health</u>. However, I think it's crucial to provide <u>adequate stimulation</u> and exercise for indoor pets so they don't become bored or <u>develop behavioral issues</u>. A <u>balanced approach</u> that prioritizes the animal's wellbeing is most important."
    },
    {
      question: "Have you ever had a pet before?",
      answer: "Yes, I have! Growing up, my family had a golden retriever named Max who was with us for twelve wonderful years. He was truly a <u>beloved member</u> of our family. I have so many <u>fond memories</u> of playing with him in the garden, taking him for walks, and how he'd always greet us excitedly when we came home. Taking care of him taught me a lot about <u>responsibility</u> – feeding, grooming, and making sure he got enough exercise. When he passed away, it was incredibly difficult; I <u>grieved</u> for him like I would for any family member. That experience showed me both the <u>joy and heartbreak</u> that come with having a pet. I'd definitely consider getting a pet again when my living situation allows."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the most popular animal in your country?",
      answer: "In my country, dogs are probably the most popular pets, followed closely by cats. Many families keep dogs both as <u>companions</u> and for <u>security purposes</u>. Small dog breeds have become increasingly popular in urban areas where living space is limited. Cats are favored by people who want a more <u>low-maintenance</u> pet that can be left alone during work hours. Fish are also quite common, especially among those living in apartments, as they require less space and attention. In recent years, there's been a growing interest in more <u>exotic pets</u> like rabbits and hamsters, particularly among younger people. The <u>pet industry</u> has grown significantly, with more pet shops, grooming services, and veterinary clinics <u>catering to</u> this increasing demand."

  food: [
    {
      question: "What is your favourite food?",
      answer: "My absolute favourite food is homemade pasta, particularly a good <u>carbonara</u> or <u>bolognese</u>. There's something incredibly <u>comforting and satisfying</u> about a well-made pasta dish. I love the versatility of pasta – it can be simple or elaborate, light or hearty, depending on the sauce and ingredients. The combination of <u>al dente</u> pasta with a rich, flavorful sauce is just perfect for me. I appreciate that it's a dish with a long <u>culinary tradition</u> and that different regions have their own variations. When I have time on weekends, I sometimes make fresh pasta from scratch, which takes the experience to another level. It's also a dish that brings back happy memories of family dinners and special occasions."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of food did you like when you were young?",
      answer: "When I was young, I had quite <u>typical childhood preferences</u> – I loved anything sweet and was <u>particularly fond of</u> fast food like pizza, burgers, and fried chicken. I also had a weakness for sugary cereals and snacks. Like many children, I was a bit of a <u>picky eater</u> and would avoid vegetables whenever possible. I remember being very excited about birthday cakes and ice cream. Interestingly, I also loved my grandmother's cooking, especially her homemade soups and dumplings – perhaps because they were made with such love and <u>reminded me of</u> happy family gatherings. My <u>palate</u> was definitely simpler back then, and I didn't appreciate more <u>complex flavors</u> until I got older."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you eat different foods at different times of the year?",
      answer: "Yes, definitely! My eating habits <u>vary quite a bit</u> with the seasons. In winter, I <u>gravitate towards</u> warm, <u>hearty dishes</u> like stews, soups, and roasts – foods that are comforting and help you <u>feel warm inside</u>. Summer calls for lighter fare – fresh salads, grilled vegetables, seafood, and plenty of fruits. I also enjoy <u>seasonal produce</u>; there's nothing quite like fresh strawberries in summer or pumpkin dishes in autumn. Certain holidays and festivals are also <u>associated with</u> specific foods in my culture, so I eat traditional dishes during those times. I think eating <u>seasonally</u> not only makes sense nutritionally but also keeps meals interesting throughout the year and helps you <u>appreciate the changing seasons</u>."
    },
    {
      question: "Has your favourite food changed since you were a child?",
      answer: "Absolutely, my food preferences have <u>evolved significantly</u>. As a child, I was all about simple, familiar flavors – nothing too adventurous or spicy. Fast food and sweets were at the top of my list. Now, my tastes are much more <u>sophisticated and diverse</u>. I've developed an appreciation for foods I once avoided, like seafood, spicy dishes, and various vegetables. I've also become more interested in <u>international cuisines</u> and enjoy trying new things from different cultures. Health considerations have also <u>influenced my choices</u> – I'm more conscious now of eating <u>nutritious, balanced meals</u>. While I still enjoy occasional <u>comfort food</u> from my childhood, my everyday preferences have definitely <u>matured</u>. I think traveling and exposure to different foods played a big role in this <u>transformation</u>."

  dayOff: [
    {
      question: "When was the last time you had a few days off?",
      answer: "The last time I had a few consecutive days off was about a month ago during a public holiday weekend. I had four days off in total, which felt like a <u>real luxury</u>. It was a much-needed <u>break from</u> the usual work routine. I used the time to <u>recharge and relax</u> – catching up on sleep, spending quality time with family, and doing some activities I'd been putting off. Having multiple days off in a row is quite different from just a regular weekend; it gives you enough time to truly <u>unwind</u> without feeling rushed. I came back to work feeling <u>refreshed and rejuvenated</u>. I try to <u>take advantage of</u> public holidays and plan ahead so I can enjoy longer breaks when possible."
    },
    {
      question: "What do you usually do when you have days off?",
      answer: "On my days off, I like to have a <u>balance of</u> relaxation and activity. I typically start by <u>sleeping in</u> a bit – something I can't do on workdays. I enjoy having a <u>leisurely breakfast</u> and catching up on reading or watching shows I've been meaning to see. I also use the time for <u>personal errands</u> and household tasks that pile up during the week. If the weather is nice, I like to <u>get outdoors</u> – perhaps go for a hike, visit a park, or explore a new area of the city. Meeting up with friends for coffee or a meal is also something I <u>look forward to</u>. I try not to <u>over-schedule</u> my days off though; having some <u>unstructured time</u> is important for true relaxation."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you usually spend your days off with your parents or with your friends?",
      answer: "It's usually a <u>mix of both</u>, depending on various factors. I try to visit my parents at least once or twice a month, so some of my days off are dedicated to <u>family time</u>. I enjoy having meals together, helping them with things around the house, or just chatting and catching up. On other days off, I prefer spending time with friends – going out for activities, meals, or just <u>hanging out</u> together. Sometimes I also enjoy <u>solo time</u> on my days off to pursue personal interests or simply have some <u>quiet moments</u>. I think it's healthy to <u>distribute your time</u> among different relationships. As I've gotten older, I've come to <u>value</u> the time with my parents even more."
    },
    {
      question: "What would you like to do if you had a day off tomorrow?",
      answer: "If I had an unexpected day off tomorrow, I'd probably start by sleeping in without an alarm – such a <u>simple pleasure</u> that I don't often get! Then I'd have a nice, <u>unhurried breakfast</u> while listening to music or a podcast. Since the weather has been lovely lately, I'd <u>make the most of</u> it by going for a long walk in a nearby park or perhaps cycling along the river. In the afternoon, I might visit a café I've been wanting to try and spend some time reading there. I'd probably also call a friend to see if they're free for dinner. It would be a day focused on things that <u>bring me joy</u> without any <u>obligations or pressure</u>. The key would be to keep it <u>spontaneous and relaxed</u>."
    },
  ],
  hobby: [
    {
      question: "Do you have any hobbies?",
      answer: "Yes, I have several hobbies that I'm quite <u>passionate about</u>. Photography is probably my main one – I love <u>capturing moments</u> and experimenting with different techniques. I also enjoy reading, particularly fiction and <u>self-improvement books</u>. When I have more time on weekends, I like to go hiking and <u>explore nature</u>. I find that having <u>diverse hobbies</u> helps me <u>maintain a healthy balance</u> in life; some are more <u>mentally stimulating</u> while others are <u>physically active</u>. These activities help me <u>unwind</u> after work and give me something to <u>look forward to</u> during busy periods."
    },
    {
      question: "Did you have any hobbies when you were a child?",
      answer: "Oh yes, I had quite a few hobbies as a child! I was really <u>into</u> drawing and painting – I would spend hours with my colored pencils and sketchbooks creating all sorts of pictures. I also loved <u>collecting things</u>, particularly stamps and stickers, which was very popular among kids back then. Building with LEGO blocks was another <u>favorite pastime</u> of mine; I could <u>lose track of time</u> constructing elaborate structures. Looking back, those hobbies really helped <u>nurture my creativity</u> and <u>attention to detail</u>. They were simpler times when entertainment didn't rely so heavily on technology."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you have a hobby that you've had since childhood?",
      answer: "Yes, actually – reading has been a <u>constant companion</u> throughout my life. I <u>developed a love for</u> books when I was very young, and it's a hobby that has <u>stayed with me</u> ever since. Of course, my reading preferences have <u>evolved over time</u>; as a child, I devoured fairy tales and adventure stories, whereas now I'm more drawn to literary fiction and non-fiction. The <u>fundamental joy</u> of <u>getting lost in a good book</u>, however, has never changed. I think it's wonderful to have a hobby that <u>grows with you</u> and continues to <u>enrich your life</u> across different stages."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you have the same hobbies as your family members?",
      answer: "There's some <u>overlap</u>, but also quite a few differences. My mother and I both enjoy cooking, so we often <u>exchange recipes</u> and sometimes cook together during family gatherings. My father is an <u>avid reader</u> like me, so we frequently <u>recommend books</u> to each other and have interesting discussions about what we've read. However, my brother is really into video gaming, which isn't something I <u>particularly share</u>. I think having some <u>common interests</u> helps us <u>bond</u>, while our different hobbies give us our own <u>individual identities</u>. It's nice to have both <u>shared activities</u> and personal pursuits within a family."

  morningTime: [
    {
      question: "Do you like getting up early in the morning?",
      answer: "Honestly, I have a bit of a <u>love-hate relationship</u> with early mornings. I wouldn't call myself a <u>natural early riser</u>, and the initial moment of waking up can be quite challenging. However, I've come to <u>appreciate the benefits</u> of starting my day early. There's something peaceful about the <u>quiet hours</u> before the world gets busy – I find I'm more <u>productive and focused</u> during this time. Over the years, I've trained myself to wake up around 6:30 AM on weekdays, and I've noticed it really helps me <u>get a head start</u> on the day. That said, I do <u>treasure the opportunity</u> to <u>sleep in</u> on weekends!"
    },
    {
      question: "What do you usually do in the morning?",
      answer: "I have a fairly <u>consistent morning routine</u> that helps me start the day right. After waking up, I usually spend a few minutes stretching and doing some light exercises to <u>get my blood flowing</u>. Then I take a shower, which really helps me <u>feel refreshed</u> and alert. Breakfast is an important part of my morning – I typically have something healthy like oatmeal or eggs with toast. While eating, I often <u>catch up on</u> the news or listen to a podcast. I also try to <u>set aside</u> about 15 minutes for planning my day and reviewing my <u>to-do list</u>. This routine has become quite <u>ingrained</u> and really helps me feel <u>prepared and organized</u>."
    },
    {
      question: "What did you do in the morning when you were little? Why?",
      answer: "When I was a child, my mornings were quite different from now. My mother would usually wake me up, and I'd have breakfast that she prepared – often something quick like cereal or toast. I remember watching cartoons while eating, which was a <u>highlight of my mornings</u>. Then there was the <u>rush to get ready</u> for school – brushing teeth, getting dressed in my uniform, and packing my school bag. My mornings were largely <u>structured around</u> the school schedule, so there wasn't much <u>flexibility</u>. I didn't have the <u>self-discipline</u> to wake up on my own back then, and I certainly didn't appreciate the value of a good morning routine like I do now!"
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any differences between what you do in the morning now and what you did in the past?",
      answer: "Yes, there are quite significant differences. In the past, especially during my student years, my mornings were much more <u>rushed and chaotic</u>. I would often <u>hit the snooze button</u> multiple times and then scramble to get ready at the last minute. I rarely ate a proper breakfast and certainly didn't have any <u>structured routine</u>. Now, I'm much more <u>intentional</u> about how I spend my mornings. I wake up earlier, exercise regularly, and <u>take my time</u> with breakfast. I've also <u>incorporated</u> mindfulness practices like brief meditation. The biggest change is probably my <u>mindset</u> – I now see mornings as valuable time for <u>self-care</u> rather than just a necessary <u>transition</u> to the workday."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you spend your mornings doing the same things on both weekends and weekdays? Why?",
      answer: "Not entirely – while some elements remain consistent, there are notable differences. On weekdays, my mornings are more <u>time-pressured</u> and <u>efficiency-focused</u> because I need to get ready for work. I follow a <u>stricter schedule</u> and don't have much room for <u>leisurely activities</u>. On weekends, however, I allow myself to <u>take things slower</u>. I might wake up a bit later, enjoy a more <u>elaborate breakfast</u>, and spend time reading or going for a morning walk without watching the clock. The core habits like showering and having breakfast remain the same, but the <u>pace and atmosphere</u> are quite different. I think this balance works well – weekdays require structure, while weekends offer the <u>flexibility to recharge</u>."

  gifts: [
    {
      question: "Have you ever sent handmade gifts to others?",
      answer: "Yes, I have, and I find <u>handmade gifts</u> to be incredibly <u>meaningful</u>. A few years ago, I made a <u>photo album</u> for my best friend's birthday, filled with pictures from our years of friendship along with handwritten notes and memories. It took quite a bit of time and effort, but seeing her reaction made it all <u>worthwhile</u>. I've also made handmade cards for various occasions – they may not be professionally made, but I believe the <u>personal touch</u> and <u>thought behind them</u> make them more <u>valuable</u> than store-bought alternatives. There's something special about knowing someone <u>invested their time and creativity</u> into making something just for you."
    },
    {
      question: "Have you ever received a great gift?",
      answer: "Absolutely! The most <u>memorable gift</u> I've ever received was a watch from my parents when I graduated from university. It wasn't just about the <u>monetary value</u> – it was about what it <u>symbolized</u>: their pride in my achievement and their support throughout my education. They had it <u>engraved</u> with the graduation date on the back, which made it even more <u>personal and special</u>. I still wear it on important occasions as it reminds me of that <u>milestone</u> and my family's love. I think the best gifts are those that carry <u>emotional significance</u> and show that the giver truly understands and cares about you."
    },
    {
      question: "What do you consider when choosing a gift?",
      answer: "Several factors <u>come into play</u> when I'm choosing a gift. First and foremost, I think about the <u>recipient's interests and preferences</u> – a good gift should reflect that you know and understand the person. I also consider the <u>occasion</u>; a birthday gift might be different from a thank-you gift or a holiday present. <u>Practicality</u> is another factor – I prefer giving things that people will actually use rather than items that might just <u>collect dust</u>. My budget is also a <u>consideration</u>, though I believe <u>thoughtfulness matters more</u> than price. Finally, I try to think about whether the gift is something they wouldn't typically buy for themselves, as this often makes presents more <u>exciting and appreciated</u>."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you think you are good at choosing gifts?",
      answer: "I'd like to think I'm <u>reasonably good</u> at it, though it really depends on how well I know the person. For close friends and family, I usually <u>manage to find</u> gifts that they genuinely appreciate because I <u>pay attention to</u> their interests and things they mention wanting throughout the year. I keep mental notes of items they've <u>admired</u> or needs they've expressed. However, I find it more challenging to choose gifts for people I don't know as well – in those cases, I might <u>play it safe</u> with more <u>universally appealing</u> options. I've definitely had some <u>hits and misses</u> over the years, but I always <u>put genuine thought</u> into my choices."
    },
    {
      question: "What gift have you received recently?",
      answer: "The most recent gift I received was a <u>wireless speaker</u> from my sister for my birthday last month. She knows I love listening to music and podcasts, and my old speaker had been <u>on its last legs</u> for a while. It was a really <u>thoughtful choice</u> because she remembered me mentioning that I wanted a portable one for when I travel. The sound quality is excellent, and it's become something I use almost daily. What made it even more special was that she included a handwritten card expressing how much our <u>sibling bond</u> means to her. It's these <u>personal touches</u> that really <u>elevate a gift</u> from nice to truly <u>memorable</u>."

  reading: [
    {
      question: "Do you like reading?",
      answer: "Yes, I absolutely love reading! It's been one of my <u>greatest passions</u> for as long as I can remember. I find reading to be both <u>entertaining and enriching</u> – it allows me to <u>escape into different worlds</u>, learn new things, and gain <u>fresh perspectives</u>. I try to read for at least 30 minutes every day, usually before bed. My reading tastes are quite <u>eclectic</u>; I enjoy everything from literary fiction to popular science books. There's something deeply <u>satisfying</u> about <u>getting lost in a good book</u> and emerging with new ideas or emotions. I genuinely believe reading has <u>shaped who I am</u> and continues to <u>broaden my horizons</u>."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you prefer to read on paper or on a screen?",
      answer: "I have a <u>slight preference</u> for reading on paper, though I use both depending on the situation. There's something special about the <u>tactile experience</u> of holding a physical book – the feel of the pages, the smell of paper, and the satisfaction of seeing your progress as you move through it. I find it easier to <u>concentrate</u> and <u>retain information</u> when reading physical books. However, I also appreciate the <u>convenience</u> of e-readers for traveling or reading in bed without disturbing anyone. For longer books, e-readers are lighter to hold. So while my heart is with <u>traditional books</u>, I recognize the <u>practical advantages</u> of digital reading and use both formats regularly."
    },
    {
      question: "When do you need to read carefully, and when not?",
      answer: "It really depends on the <u>purpose and nature</u> of what I'm reading. I read carefully when dealing with <u>complex material</u> that requires deep understanding – things like academic papers, legal documents, or <u>technical instructions</u>. I also read more attentively when enjoying literary fiction where the <u>language and style</u> are part of the pleasure. On the other hand, I might read more quickly when <u>skimming through</u> news articles, browsing social media, or reviewing emails that don't require detailed responses. I think being able to <u>adjust your reading speed</u> according to the content is an important skill – not everything deserves the same level of <u>careful attention</u>, and knowing when to <u>speed up or slow down</u> helps manage time effectively."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you prefer scanning or detailed reading?",
      answer: "I use both approaches depending on my <u>goals and circumstances</u>. For pleasure reading or when I really need to understand something thoroughly, I definitely prefer <u>detailed reading</u>. I like to <u>savor the language</u>, reflect on ideas, and sometimes even re-read passages that <u>resonate with me</u>. However, in our <u>information-rich world</u>, scanning has become an essential skill. When I'm researching something online, checking emails, or trying to find specific information in a long document, <u>scanning efficiently</u> saves valuable time. I'd say I probably spend more time scanning throughout my day due to work demands, but the reading I <u>cherish most</u> is the detailed kind – that's when reading feels most <u>rewarding and immersive</u>."
    },
  ],
  walking: [
    {
      question: "Do you walk a lot?",
      answer: "Yes, I walk quite a bit, actually. I try to <u>incorporate walking</u> into my daily routine as much as possible. I usually walk to the nearby shops instead of driving, and I often take a <u>stroll during my lunch break</u> to <u>clear my head</u> and get some fresh air. On weekends, I enjoy longer walks in parks or along the riverside. I'd estimate I walk around 7,000 to 10,000 steps on most days. I find walking to be an excellent form of <u>low-impact exercise</u> that doesn't require any special equipment or preparation. It's also great <u>thinking time</u> – some of my best ideas have come to me while walking. Overall, it's become an <u>integral part</u> of my lifestyle."
    },

      question: "Did you often go outside to have a walk when you were a child?",
      answer: "Yes, I did, though it was quite different from how I walk now. As a child, walking was more about <u>play and exploration</u> than exercise. I would walk to and from school with friends, and we'd often <u>take detours</u> through interesting streets or stop to look at things that caught our attention. On weekends, my family would sometimes go for walks together in the local park. I also remember walking around the neighborhood with friends, just <u>hanging out</u> and chatting. Back then, walking felt more <u>spontaneous and carefree</u> – we weren't counting steps or thinking about health benefits; it was simply a natural way to <u>get around</u> and spend time with others."

    {
      question: "Why do people like to walk in parks?",
      answer: "I think there are several reasons why parks are such popular walking destinations. First, they offer a <u>natural environment</u> that provides a welcome <u>escape from</u> the concrete and noise of urban life. Being surrounded by <u>greenery and fresh air</u> has a <u>calming effect</u> and can significantly reduce stress. Parks also tend to have well-maintained paths that are <u>pleasant and safe</u> for walking. Many people enjoy the opportunity to <u>observe wildlife</u>, see seasonal changes in plants, or simply appreciate the <u>scenic beauty</u>. Parks also serve as <u>social spaces</u> where people can walk with friends, family, or pets. Research has shown that spending time in nature <u>boosts mental well-being</u>, which explains why people are <u>drawn to</u> park walks."

    {
      question: "Where would you like to take a long walk if you had the chance?",
      answer: "If I had the chance, I would love to walk along the <u>Camino de Santiago</u> in Spain. It's a famous <u>pilgrimage route</u> that stretches hundreds of kilometers, and I've heard it's a <u>transformative experience</u>. The idea of walking through <u>diverse landscapes</u> – from mountains to valleys to historic towns – really appeals to me. I'm also drawn to the <u>spiritual and reflective</u> aspect of such a journey; having days of walking gives you time to think and <u>gain perspective</u> on life. Alternatively, I'd love to hike through the Scottish Highlands, with its <u>dramatic scenery</u> and <u>rugged beauty</u>. Either would be an <u>unforgettable adventure</u> that combines physical challenge with natural beauty."

    {
      question: "Where did you go for a walk lately?",
      answer: "Just last weekend, I went for a lovely walk along the riverfront in my city. The weather was beautiful – sunny but not too hot – which made it perfect for being outdoors. I walked for about an hour, following the <u>waterside path</u> that's lined with trees and benches. There were lots of other people out enjoying the day – families with children, cyclists, and people walking their dogs. I stopped at a small café along the way for a coffee and just <u>soaked in</u> the pleasant atmosphere. It was exactly the kind of <u>relaxing activity</u> I needed after a busy work week. These simple walks have become something I really <u>look forward to</u> as a way to <u>recharge</u>."

      question: "Are there tall buildings near your home?",
      answer: "Yes, there are quite a few <u>high-rise buildings</u> in my neighborhood. I live in a fairly <u>developed urban area</u>, so there are several <u>residential towers</u> and <u>commercial complexes</u> nearby. The tallest one is probably around 30 stories high and serves as a <u>landmark</u> in our area. Over the past few years, I've noticed more and more <u>skyscrapers</u> being constructed as the city continues to <u>expand vertically</u>. While they do <u>block some natural light</u> occasionally, I appreciate how they make the <u>skyline</u> look more impressive, especially at night when they're all <u>lit up</u>."

      question: "Do you take photos of buildings?",
      answer: "Yes, I do occasionally, especially when I come across buildings with <u>striking architecture</u> or <u>unique designs</u>. I'm quite <u>fascinated by</u> how architects combine <u>functionality with aesthetics</u>. When I travel to new cities, I make it a point to photograph <u>iconic structures</u> and historical buildings. I find that <u>architectural photography</u> can be quite challenging because you need to consider angles, lighting, and <u>perspective</u> to truly <u>capture the essence</u> of a building. I've built up quite a collection of photos featuring everything from <u>modern glass towers</u> to <u>ancient temples</u> and <u>colonial-era structures</u>."
    },

      question: "Is there a building that you would like to visit?",
      answer: "Absolutely! I've always dreamed of visiting the <u>Sagrada Familia</u> in Barcelona, Spain. I've seen countless photos and documentaries about this <u>magnificent basilica</u> designed by Antoni Gaudí, and the <u>intricate details</u> and <u>unconventional design</u> have always <u>captivated me</u>. What fascinates me most is that it's been <u>under construction</u> for over a century and still isn't complete. The way natural light <u>filters through</u> the <u>stained glass windows</u> creating a <u>kaleidoscope of colors</u> inside is something I'd love to experience <u>firsthand</u>. It's definitely at the top of my <u>bucket list</u>."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you want to live in a tall building?",
      answer: "I have <u>mixed feelings</u> about this. On one hand, living in a tall building offers some <u>appealing benefits</u> like <u>panoramic views</u>, better security, and often access to <u>amenities</u> like gyms and pools. The higher floors also tend to be quieter and have better air quality. However, there are <u>drawbacks</u> to consider as well – waiting for elevators can be <u>time-consuming</u>, and there's always a slight concern about <u>emergency evacuation</u>. I think I'd prefer living somewhere around the 10th to 15th floor – high enough to enjoy nice views but not so high that it feels <u>disconnected from</u> street life. <u>On balance</u>, I'd say I'm open to the idea if the right opportunity came along."

I love observing how the <u>landscape changes</u> – from <u>bustling city streets</u> to <u>peaceful countryside</u> and back again.

      question: "Do you prefer the mountains or the sea?",

There's something incredibly <u>majestic</u> and <u>humbling</u> about being surrounded by <u>towering peaks</u>. I love the fresh mountain air, the <u>tranquility</u>, and the sense of <u>accomplishment</u> that comes with hiking to a <u>summit</u>. The <u>diverse ecosystems</u> you encounter at different <u>elevations</u> are also fascinating. That said, I do enjoy the sea as well – the sound of waves is very <u>soothing</u>, and there's nothing quite like watching a <u>sunset over the ocean</u>. Ideally, I'd love to visit places where mountains meet the sea, giving me the <u>best of both worlds</u>."

      answer: "Yes, very much so! <u>Landscape photography</u> has become one of my favorite hobbies over the years. I find it incredibly <u>rewarding</u> to <u>capture the beauty</u> of nature and <u>preserve those moments</u> forever. I've learned that the best scenery photos often require patience – waiting for the <u>golden hour</u> light or the perfect cloud formation can make all the difference. I particularly enjoy photographing <u>dramatic landscapes</u> like mountain ranges, coastlines, and forests during different seasons. It's also taught me to <u>appreciate my surroundings</u> more and notice details I might otherwise <u>overlook</u>. I've even started a small Instagram account to share my <u>nature photography</u>."

One that <u>stands out</u> in my memory is watching the sunrise over a sea of clouds from a mountain peak – it was absolutely <u>awe-inspiring</u> and made me feel like I was floating above the world. Another <u>unforgettable experience</u> was seeing the <u>crystal-clear waters</u> of a tropical beach for the first time; the <u>vibrant shades</u> of turquoise and blue were more beautiful than any photograph could capture. I was also deeply moved by the sight of ancient rice terraces carved into mountainsides – the way humans have <u>shaped the landscape</u> over centuries while <u>working in harmony</u> with nature was truly <u>remarkable</u>. These experiences have <u>instilled in me</u> a deep appreciation for our planet's beauty."

      question: "Do you prefer typing or handwriting?",
      answer: "For most purposes, I definitely prefer typing. It's much <u>faster and more efficient</u>, especially for longer documents or when I need to <u>edit and revise</u> my work frequently. I can type at around 70 words per minute, which is considerably faster than I can write by hand. Typing also makes it easier to <u>organize my thoughts</u> and <u>share documents</u> with others. However, I still <u>appreciate handwriting</u> for certain situations – like writing personal letters, taking quick notes, or <u>brainstorming ideas</u>. There's something more <u>personal and intimate</u> about handwritten messages. I also find that writing by hand sometimes helps me <u>retain information</u> better when studying. So while typing is my <u>go-to method</u>, handwriting still has its place."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you type on a desktop or laptop keyboard every day?",
      answer: "Yes, I type on a keyboard virtually every day. I use a laptop for my work, so I spend several hours daily typing emails, reports, and various documents. I'd estimate I type for at least four to five hours on a typical workday. On weekends, I still use my laptop, though perhaps not as intensively – maybe for <u>personal correspondence</u>, browsing the internet, or working on <u>side projects</u>. I've actually invested in an <u>ergonomic external keyboard</u> for my home setup because typing for <u>extended periods</u> on a laptop keyboard was causing some <u>wrist discomfort</u>. The mechanical keyboard I bought has made a significant difference in both <u>comfort and typing speed</u>."
    },
    {
      question: "When did you learn how to type on a keyboard?",
      answer: "I first learned to type when I was around 10 or 11 years old, back when my family got our first computer. Initially, I used the <u>hunt-and-peck method</u>, looking at the keyboard and using just two fingers. It wasn't until secondary school that I properly learned <u>touch typing</u> – typing without looking at the keys. We had computer classes where we used typing software that taught us the correct <u>finger placement</u> and technique. It felt quite <u>frustrating at first</u> because I was actually slower than my old method, but with <u>consistent practice</u>, I gradually <u>picked up speed</u>. Looking back, I'm really grateful for those lessons because <u>proper typing skills</u> have been <u>invaluable</u> throughout my academic and professional life."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you improve your typing?",
      answer: "There are several ways I've worked on improving my typing over the years. The most effective method for me has been <u>regular practice</u> – the more you type, the more <u>natural and fluid</u> it becomes. I've also used online typing games and tests that make practice more <u>engaging and fun</u> while tracking my progress. Focusing on <u>accuracy first</u> rather than speed was important; I learned that speed naturally increases once you <u>reduce errors</u>. Another tip is to maintain <u>proper posture</u> and hand position – keeping your wrists elevated and fingers curved over the <u>home row keys</u>. I've also found that typing actual content, like journal entries or essays, is more beneficial than just doing <u>repetitive drills</u>. Nowadays, I occasionally <u>challenge myself</u> with typing tests to ensure I'm maintaining my skills."

I used to spend hours <u>riding my bike</u> around the neighborhood with my friends, and we'd often <u>make up</u> imaginative games together. I was also really into building things with LEGO blocks – I could spend entire afternoons <u>constructing</u> elaborate structures. Drawing and painting were other activities I <u>was passionate about</u>; I had countless sketchbooks filled with my <u>creations</u>. Looking back, I think those <u>carefree days</u> of playing outdoors and using my imagination were some of the <u>happiest times</u> of my childhood. I also loved <u>collecting things</u> like stamps and stickers, which was quite popular among children back then."

      question: "Did you prefer to do activities alone or with a group of people when you were a child?",
      answer: "I would say I enjoyed a <u>mix of both</u>, but I had a <u>slight preference</u> for group activities. Playing with friends was always more exciting – we could <u>come up with</u> creative games together, and the <u>social interaction</u> made everything more fun. Activities like playing football, hide-and-seek, or just <u>hanging out</u> at the playground were always better with company. However, there were also times when I enjoyed <u>solitary activities</u>, particularly reading and drawing. I think spending time alone helped me <u>develop my creativity</u> and <u>independence</u>, while group activities taught me valuable <u>social skills</u> like <u>teamwork</u>, sharing, and <u>conflict resolution</u>. So both types of activities <u>contributed to</u> my personal growth in different ways."
    },

      question: "Are there any differences between the activities you liked when you were a child and those you like now?",
      answer: "Yes, there are quite a few <u>notable differences</u>. As a child, my activities were much more <u>physically active</u> and <u>spontaneous</u> – I'd run around for hours without getting tired. Nowadays, while I still enjoy some physical activities, I tend to <u>gravitate towards</u> more <u>mentally stimulating</u> pursuits like reading, learning new skills, or having meaningful conversations. Another difference is that my current hobbies are more <u>goal-oriented</u> – for example, I cook to improve my culinary skills, whereas as a child, I just played for the <u>pure joy</u> of it without any <u>specific objectives</u>. Technology has also <u>played a role</u>; I spend more time on digital activities now than I ever did as a child. However, the <u>underlying desire</u> for creativity and social connection has <u>remained constant</u> throughout my life."

I find that taking pictures helps me <u>appreciate the beauty</u> around me more deeply, and it's wonderful to <u>look back on</u> these images later.

      question: "Do you prefer views in urban areas or rural areas?",
      answer: "To be honest, I have a <u>slight preference</u> for rural views, although I can appreciate both. There's something incredibly <u>peaceful and serene</u> about <u>countryside landscapes</u> – the <u>rolling hills</u>, open fields, and <u>untouched nature</u> really help me <u>unwind</u> and <u>escape from</u> the hustle and bustle of daily life. That said, urban views have their own charm too. I find <u>city skylines</u> at night absolutely <u>breathtaking</u>, especially when all the buildings are <u>lit up</u>. The <u>architectural diversity</u> and the energy of cities can be quite <u>captivating</u>. But if I had to choose, I'd say rural areas <u>speak to my soul</u> more."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you prefer views in your own country or in other countries?",
      answer: "That's a tough question because both have their <u>unique appeal</u>. Views in my own country feel more <u>familiar and comforting</u> – there's a sense of <u>belonging</u> and <u>cultural connection</u> when I see landscapes I've known since childhood. However, I must admit that views in other countries often feel more <u>exotic and exciting</u>. There's a certain <u>thrill</u> in experiencing completely different <u>terrain</u> and scenery that you've never seen before. For instance, seeing the Swiss Alps or the beaches of Thailand was absolutely <u>awe-inspiring</u> precisely because it was so different from what I'm <u>accustomed to</u>. I think the <u>novelty factor</u> makes foreign views particularly <u>memorable</u>."
    },
    {
      question: "Have you seen an unforgettable and beautiful view or scenery?",
      answer: "Yes, I certainly have! The most <u>unforgettable view</u> I've ever seen was during a trip to the mountains about two years ago. I woke up early one morning to watch the sunrise from a <u>viewpoint</u>, and the sight was absolutely <u>spectacular</u>. The sky transformed through <u>shades of</u> orange, pink, and purple, while <u>mist</u> hung over the valleys below. It was one of those <u>rare moments</u> where I felt completely <u>in awe of</u> nature's beauty. I remember feeling incredibly <u>humbled</u> and <u>grateful</u> to witness such a <u>breathtaking scene</u>. I took many photos, but honestly, none of them could truly <u>do justice to</u> how magnificent it was in person. That experience has stayed with me and <u>ignited a passion</u> for seeking out more <u>scenic spots</u>."

Photographs and videos are probably the most common method – they help us <u>capture precious moments</u> that we can <u>look back on</u> fondly. Many people also keep journals or diaries to <u>document their experiences</u> and emotions. <u>Milestones</u> like graduations, weddings, and the birth of children often serve as <u>significant markers</u> that help us organize our memories. Additionally, certain songs, smells, or places can <u>trigger vivid recollections</u> of particular periods in our lives. I think as we <u>get older</u>, we tend to <u>reflect more</u> on our past and appreciate the <u>journey</u> we've been on."

I have enough <u>independence</u> to make my own decisions, yet I'm still young enough to <u>take risks</u> and learn from my mistakes without too many serious consequences. I feel like I'm <u>coming into my own</u> – discovering who I really am and what I want out of life. Of course, there are moments when I <u>feel overwhelmed</u> by responsibilities, but <u>on the whole</u>, I wouldn't trade this time for any other."
    },
    {
      question: "At what age do you think people are the happiest?",
      answer: "That's an interesting question, and I believe the answer <u>varies from person to person</u>. However, research suggests that people often experience a <u>U-shaped happiness curve</u> – they're happiest in their youth and later in life, with a dip in middle age. Personally, I think childhood can be a very <u>blissful time</u> because children are <u>free from</u> major worries and responsibilities. On the other hand, many older people report high levels of <u>life satisfaction</u> because they've <u>come to terms with</u> their lives and have more time to enjoy themselves. Ultimately, I believe happiness isn't <u>tied to</u> a specific age – it depends more on one's <u>mindset</u>, relationships, and <u>sense of purpose</u>."

    answer: `So this happened about a year ago with my younger cousin, Sarah. I encouraged her to apply for a <u>competitive scholarship</u> program that she was really hesitant about.

Sarah is a <u>bright and talented</u> university student who was in her second year of studying computer science. About a year ago, I learned that her university was offering a <u>prestigious scholarship</u> that would cover her tuition fees for the remaining years and provide opportunities for <u>internships at leading tech companies</u>.

When I mentioned it to her, she immediately dismissed the idea, saying she wasn't <u>qualified enough</u> and that there would be many applicants more deserving than her. She seemed quite <u>intimidated by</u> the application process, which required essays, recommendation letters, and interviews.

So I sat down with her and started <u>highlighting her achievements</u>. I reminded her about her excellent grades, the coding projects she'd completed, and her <u>volunteer work</u> teaching programming to underprivileged children. I helped her see that she had all the <u>qualities they were looking for</u>. I also offered to help her <u>review her application materials</u> and practice for the interview.

At first, she was quite <u>reluctant and skeptical</u>, but gradually she started to come around. I think what really convinced her was when I shared my own experience of almost not applying for something similar and <u>regretting it later</u>.

The reason I encouraged her was because I genuinely believed in her <u>potential</u> and didn't want her to <u>miss out on</u> an opportunity due to <u>self-doubt</u>. I knew she had what it takes, and I felt it was important to <u>push her out of her comfort zone</u>.

I'm happy to say that she did apply, and she actually <u>won the scholarship</u>! She's now thriving in her studies and has already completed an internship at a <u>well-known tech company</u>. She often tells me that she's grateful I <u>pushed her to take that leap</u>.`,

        question: "How can leaders encourage their employees?",
        answer: "Well, I think leaders can encourage their employees in several ways. First of all, <u>recognition and appreciation</u> are incredibly powerful. When leaders acknowledge good work publicly and privately, it makes employees feel valued and motivated to keep performing well. Another important thing is providing <u>opportunities for growth</u>, like training programs, challenging projects, and clear career paths. This shows employees that the organization is invested in their development. Leaders should also practice <u>active listening</u> and create an environment where employees feel comfortable sharing ideas and concerns. On top of that, setting <u>realistic yet challenging goals</u> and providing the necessary support to achieve them can be very motivating. I also believe that leading by example and maintaining a <u>positive attitude</u> during difficult times can inspire employees to persevere. And of course, offering <u>constructive feedback</u> rather than just criticism helps employees improve while feeling supported."

        question: "When should parents encourage their children?",
        answer: "I think parents should encourage their children consistently, but there are particularly <u>crucial moments</u> when encouragement is essential. For example, when children face <u>new challenges or transitions</u>, like starting school, joining a new activity, or making new friends, parental encouragement can boost their confidence significantly. It's also really important to encourage children when they experience <u>failure or setbacks</u> because this teaches them resilience and shows them that mistakes are part of learning. Parents should also encourage children when they show <u>effort and persistence</u>, not just when they succeed, as this fosters a growth mindset. When children express interest in exploring new hobbies or developing talents, encouragement can help them <u>discover their passions</u>. And during <u>difficult emotional times</u>, like dealing with peer pressure or self-doubt, parental encouragement can provide crucial emotional support."
      },
      {
        question: "What kind of encouragement should parents give?",
        answer: "In my opinion, the type of encouragement parents give should be <u>genuine, specific, and balanced</u>. Rather than generic praise like 'good job,' parents should offer <u>specific feedback</u> that acknowledges exactly what the child did well. For instance, saying something like 'I noticed how hard you worked on that math problem' is much more meaningful. Encouragement should focus on <u>effort and process</u> rather than just outcomes, teaching children that their dedication matters more than natural talent. Parents should also provide <u>emotional support</u> by validating their children's feelings and showing empathy when they face difficulties. Encouraging <u>independence and decision-making</u> helps children develop confidence in their own abilities too. It's important that encouragement is <u>honest and realistic</u> because false praise can backfire and make children distrust feedback. And finally, parents should encourage children to <u>set their own goals</u> and support them in pursuing their interests, even if those differ from what parents might have chosen."

        question: "Do you think some people are better than others at persuading?",
        answer: "Yes, I definitely believe some people are naturally more <u>skilled at persuasion</u> than others, though I also think this ability can be developed over time. People who are effective persuaders typically possess strong <u>emotional intelligence</u>, meaning they can read others' feelings, understand their perspectives, and adapt their communication accordingly. Good persuaders are often <u>excellent listeners</u> who first seek to understand before trying to be understood. They tend to be <u>confident yet not aggressive</u>, presenting their ideas with conviction while remaining respectful of others' viewpoints. <u>Credibility and trustworthiness</u> also play crucial roles because people are more likely to be persuaded by those they trust and respect. Some individuals simply have a natural <u>charisma</u> that makes them more influential. That said, persuasion skills can definitely be learned through practice, studying communication techniques, and developing empathy. Cultural factors and context also influence who is perceived as persuasive in different situations."

        question: "Should children do everything their parents ask them to do?",
        answer: "That's an interesting question, and honestly, I don't believe children should blindly follow every parental request. While <u>respecting parents</u> and following reasonable guidance is important, especially for safety and well-being, children should also learn to <u>think critically</u> and develop their own judgment. After all, parents are not infallible and may sometimes make requests that aren't in the child's best interest. Teaching children to <u>respectfully question</u> and discuss decisions helps them develop important life skills. Age-appropriate <u>autonomy</u> is crucial for healthy development because as children grow, they need increasing freedom to make their own choices and learn from consequences. However, there are <u>non-negotiable areas</u> related to safety, health, and core values where parental guidance should definitely be followed. I think the ideal approach involves <u>open communication</u> where children can express their views and parents explain their reasoning, rather than demanding blind obedience or allowing complete freedom."

        question: "How can employers encourage their staff?",
        answer: "There are quite a few ways employers can encourage their staff effectively. To start with, <u>competitive compensation and benefits</u> form the foundation because employees need to feel fairly rewarded for their work. Beyond financial incentives, <u>recognition programs</u> that celebrate achievements, both big and small, can boost morale significantly. Providing <u>professional development opportunities</u> like training, mentorship, and clear advancement paths shows employees that the company invests in their future. Creating a <u>positive work environment</u> with supportive colleagues, comfortable facilities, and good work-life balance makes employees want to contribute their best. Offering <u>autonomy and trust</u> allows employees to feel ownership over their work and make meaningful decisions. <u>Regular, constructive feedback</u> helps employees understand their progress and areas for improvement. And I think involving staff in <u>decision-making processes</u> and valuing their input makes them feel like valued members of the organization rather than just workers."

    answer: `Well, the first thing that comes to mind is a laptop I bought last year. It ended up costing me way more than I had originally planned.

When I first started looking for a new laptop, I had a budget of around $800 in mind. I just needed something <u>reliable and functional</u> for work and occasional video editing. However, after doing some research and visiting a few electronics stores, I ended up spending nearly $1,500, which was almost double my initial budget.

The reason I bought it was because my old laptop was <u>on its last legs</u>. It would freeze constantly, take forever to start up, and couldn't handle the software I needed for my job anymore. So getting a new one wasn't really optional at that point.

Now, as for why I spent more than expected, there were a few reasons. First of all, when I went to the store, the salesperson was quite <u>persuasive</u> and showed me a model with much better specifications. He explained how the <u>upgraded processor</u> and <u>additional RAM</u> would make a huge difference for video editing, and honestly, he made some valid points. I also realized that if I bought a cheaper model, I'd probably need to replace it sooner, so I started thinking of it as a <u>long-term investment</u>.

On top of that, I decided to add some accessories like a <u>protective case</u>, an extended warranty, and a wireless mouse, which all added to the final cost. Looking back, I don't regret the purchase because the laptop has been <u>incredibly reliable</u> and performs brilliantly. But it definitely taught me that it's easy to <u>get carried away</u> when you're surrounded by all these shiny new gadgets and convincing salespeople!`,

They always want the latest models with the newest features. Another big expense is <u>entertainment and experiences</u>, like going to concerts, traveling, eating out at trendy restaurants, and streaming subscriptions for music and movies. Fashion and clothing also take up a considerable chunk of their budget because many young people care a lot about <u>keeping up with trends</u> and looking good on social media. Speaking of which, some young people spend quite a bit on things that will look good in photos, like fancy coffees or Instagram-worthy brunches.

        question: "Do you think it is important to save money? Why?",
        answer: "Absolutely, I think saving money is extremely important for several reasons. First and foremost, having savings provides a <u>financial safety net</u> for unexpected situations like medical emergencies, job loss, or urgent home repairs. Without savings, people can find themselves in serious trouble when something unexpected happens. Saving also allows you to <u>achieve bigger goals</u> in life, whether that's buying a house, starting a business, or funding your children's education. It gives you more options and freedom in the long run. On top of that, saving money can reduce <u>stress and anxiety</u> because knowing you have some money set aside brings peace of mind. I also think developing a saving habit teaches <u>financial discipline</u> and helps people make more thoughtful decisions about their spending. Of course, I understand it's not always easy, especially with the rising cost of living, but even saving small amounts regularly can make a big difference over time."

        answer: "Oh, definitely! I think this is incredibly common in today's consumer society. There are several reasons why people buy things they don't actually need. One major factor is <u>advertising and marketing</u>, which is designed to create desire and make people feel like they're missing out if they don't have certain products. Social media has made this even worse because people constantly see influencers showing off new products, which creates <u>pressure to keep up</u>. Another reason is <u>emotional spending</u>, where people shop to make themselves feel better when they're stressed, bored, or unhappy. Sales and discounts also trick people into buying things just because they seem like a good deal, even if they wouldn't have bought them at full price. And let's be honest, sometimes people simply <u>lack self-control</u> or don't think carefully before making purchases. I'm guilty of this myself sometimes, especially when it comes to online shopping late at night!"

        question: "Do you think it is the rich people's responsibility to donate money to people in need?",
        answer: "This is quite a thought-provoking question. Personally, I believe that while it's not necessarily an <u>obligation</u>, wealthy people do have a certain <u>moral responsibility</u> to give back to society. They've often benefited from systems and opportunities that aren't available to everyone, so sharing some of their wealth seems like the right thing to do. That said, I don't think we should force anyone to donate because charity should come from <u>genuine compassion</u>, not compulsion. What I do think is important is that rich people pay their <u>fair share of taxes</u>, which helps fund public services that benefit everyone. Some wealthy individuals like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have <u>pledged to give away</u> most of their fortunes, which I find admirable. But ultimately, I believe everyone, regardless of how much money they have, can contribute to helping others in some way, whether through money, time, or skills."

        question: "What kind of things are people happy to pay a high price for?",
        answer: "I think people are generally willing to pay premium prices for things that fall into a few categories. First, <u>quality and durability</u> are big factors. People will pay more for products that are well-made and will last a long time, like a good pair of leather shoes or a reliable car. Second, anything related to <u>health and well-being</u> tends to command higher prices, such as organic food, gym memberships, or quality healthcare. People also happily spend more on <u>experiences and memories</u>, like dream vacations, special occasions, or once-in-a-lifetime events like weddings. <u>Status symbols</u> are another category where people don't mind paying extra, whether it's designer clothing, luxury watches, or expensive cars that signal success. Convenience is also worth a lot to many people, so services that save time, like food delivery or cleaning services, can justify higher prices. And finally, people pay premium prices for things that have <u>sentimental or emotional value</u>, like engagement rings or gifts for loved ones."

    answer: `The person I want to talk about is my neighbor, Mrs. Chen. She's probably the most <u>kind-hearted and generous</u> person I know.

Mrs. Chen is a retired schoolteacher in her mid-sixties who has lived next door to my family for over fifteen years. Even though she's no longer working, she keeps herself incredibly busy helping everyone in our community.

She helps others almost on a <u>daily basis</u>, and I'm not exaggerating. In the mornings, you'll often see her helping elderly neighbors carry their groceries or walking their dogs when they're feeling unwell. She also <u>volunteers</u> at the local community center twice a week, where she teaches free English classes to immigrant families. On weekends, she organizes <u>neighborhood clean-up events</u> and collects donations for local charities.

As for why she does all this, I think it simply comes from her <u>genuine love for people</u>. She once told me that after spending decades as a teacher, helping others just became second nature to her. She believes that small acts of kindness can <u>make a real difference</u> in people's lives, and she finds great joy in seeing others happy. I also think staying active and connected to the community keeps her feeling <u>young and purposeful</u>.

Honestly, I have tremendous <u>respect and admiration</u> for Mrs. Chen. She's taught me that you don't need money or power to make a positive impact on the world. What I find most inspiring is that she never expects anything in return and never brags about what she does. She's the kind of person who <u>restores your faith in humanity</u>. I often think that if more people were like her, the world would be a much better place. She's definitely someone I <u>look up to</u> and try to learn from.`,

        question: "What can children do to help their parents?",
        answer: "There are plenty of ways children can help their parents, even from a young age. The most obvious one is helping with <u>household chores</u> like tidying their rooms, setting the table, washing dishes, or taking out the rubbish. These might seem like small tasks, but they really do <u>lighten the load</u> for busy parents. Older children can take on more responsibilities like cooking simple meals, doing laundry, or looking after younger siblings. Beyond physical tasks, children can also help by simply <u>being considerate</u> and not creating unnecessary problems or stress. For example, doing their homework without being told, getting ready for school on time, and being honest about their activities. I think even just showing <u>appreciation and gratitude</u> for what their parents do means a lot. Sometimes just giving mum or dad a hug after a long day can make a big difference!"

      {
        question: "Should children help their parents with household chores?",
        answer: "Yes, I strongly believe children should help with household chores, and there are several good reasons for this. First of all, it teaches them <u>responsibility and life skills</u> that they'll need when they eventually live on their own. I've met university students who don't know how to do basic things like cook rice or do laundry, and that's a real problem. Helping with chores also teaches children that running a household is a <u>team effort</u> and that they're part of a family unit, not just guests being served. It builds their <u>work ethic</u> and shows them that things don't just magically get done. Of course, the tasks should be <u>age-appropriate</u>, and parents shouldn't overburden their children, especially with schoolwork to consider. But I think finding a reasonable balance where children contribute is definitely beneficial for their development and also fair to the parents who work hard to provide for them."

        question: "What kind of help do people need when looking for a new job?",
        answer: "Job hunting can be quite challenging, so people often need various types of support. One of the most important things is help with their <u>CV and cover letter</u>. Having someone review these documents and give honest feedback can make a huge difference because sometimes we're blind to our own mistakes or don't know how to present ourselves effectively. People also benefit from <u>interview preparation</u>, like practicing common questions and getting tips on body language and presentation. Networking is another area where help is valuable because many jobs are found through <u>personal connections</u> rather than job boards. Sometimes people just need <u>emotional support and encouragement</u> because job searching can be demoralizing, especially if you face rejections. Practical help like knowing which websites to use, understanding the job market, or getting <u>referrals</u> from people already working in the industry can also be incredibly useful. And for those changing careers, guidance on <u>retraining or upskilling</u> is often needed."
      },
      {
        question: "Who should people ask for help, colleagues or family members?",
        answer: "I think it really depends on what kind of help you need. For <u>work-related matters</u>, colleagues are usually the better choice because they understand the context, the workplace dynamics, and the specific challenges you're facing. They can offer practical advice based on their experience in the same environment. However, for <u>personal or emotional issues</u>, family members are often more appropriate because they know you deeply and have your best interests at heart without any professional complications. There's also the issue of <u>confidentiality</u> to consider. You might not want colleagues to know about certain personal struggles, and similarly, you might not want to burden family with work problems they can't really help with. I think the ideal approach is to have <u>both support systems</u> and know when to turn to each. Sometimes you need professional advice, and sometimes you just need someone who loves you unconditionally to listen and comfort you."

        question: "Do you think schools should teach children to do household chores?",
        answer: "Yes, I actually think this would be a great idea. While some might argue that chores should be taught at home, the reality is that not all parents have the time or knowledge to teach these skills properly. Including <u>basic life skills</u> in the school curriculum would ensure that all children, regardless of their home situation, learn how to take care of themselves. In some countries like Japan, students are already responsible for <u>cleaning their classrooms</u> and serving school lunches, which teaches them responsibility and teamwork. Schools could teach practical things like basic cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, and even simple home repairs. This would be especially valuable for children who might come from households where one parent does everything or where these skills aren't prioritized. It would also help <u>challenge gender stereotypes</u> by showing all children that everyone should know how to take care of a home. Of course, this shouldn't take away from academic subjects, but incorporating it as part of a well-rounded education makes a lot of sense to me."

        question: "Why are employees reluctant to ask their managers for help?",
        answer: "There are quite a few reasons why employees hesitate to approach their managers for help. The biggest one is probably <u>fear of looking incompetent</u>. People worry that if they ask for help, their manager will think they can't do their job properly, which could affect their performance reviews or chances of promotion. There's also a <u>power dynamic</u> at play that makes some employees feel intimidated or uncomfortable being vulnerable in front of their boss. Some employees have had <u>bad experiences</u> in the past where asking for help was met with criticism or impatience, so they've learned to avoid it. In certain workplace cultures, there's an expectation that people should <u>figure things out on their own</u>, and asking for help is seen as a weakness rather than a smart move. Sometimes managers are simply <u>too busy or unapproachable</u>, and employees don't want to bother them. I think good managers should actively create an environment where asking questions is encouraged, because ultimately, it leads to fewer mistakes and better outcomes for everyone."

    answer: `This happened last year when I had to plan a surprise birthday party for my best friend. I really needed to use my imagination for this one.

It was around September, about two weeks before her 30th birthday. I wanted to do something really special and memorable for her, but I had a limited budget and couldn't just book an expensive venue or hire professional party planners. So I really had to <u>get creative</u> and think outside the box.

The reason I needed to use my imagination was because I wanted the party to be <u>personal and meaningful</u> rather than just a generic celebration. I knew my friend loved the beach and had always dreamed of visiting Greece, so I came up with this idea of transforming my small apartment into a Greek island theme. I had to imagine how to recreate that <u>Mediterranean atmosphere</u> using everyday items and affordable decorations.

Honestly, it was both challenging and fun at the same time. The difficult part was <u>visualizing the end result</u> and figuring out how to achieve it practically. I spent hours browsing online for inspiration and sketching out ideas. I had to imagine how blue and white fabrics could become a Greek backdrop, how fairy lights could mimic a sunset, and how to arrange everything in my limited space. The easier part was once I got into the <u>creative flow</u>, ideas just started coming naturally.

I felt incredibly <u>proud and satisfied</u> when everything came together. Seeing my friend's face when she walked in and saw the transformation was absolutely priceless. She was so touched that I had put so much thought and effort into it. The whole experience reminded me how powerful imagination can be. It taught me that you don't always need a big budget to create something special. You just need to <u>think creatively</u> and be willing to put in the effort to bring your ideas to life.`,

        question: "Do you think adults can have lots of imagination?",
        answer: "Absolutely, I believe adults can definitely have lots of imagination. However, I think many adults don't <u>nurture or express</u> their imagination as much as they could. When we're children, we're constantly encouraged to play, create, and imagine, but as we grow up, we're often told to be more practical and realistic. This can make adults feel like imagination is something childish or unproductive. But if you look at successful entrepreneurs, artists, writers, and innovators, they all have <u>incredibly active imaginations</u>. The difference is that some adults actively <u>cultivate their creativity</u> while others let it fade away. I think things like reading fiction, engaging in hobbies, traveling, and exposing yourself to new experiences can help adults maintain and even strengthen their imagination. It's really about giving yourself <u>permission to dream</u> and not being afraid to think differently."

        question: "Do you think imagination is essential for scientists?",
        answer: "Yes, I think imagination is absolutely essential for scientists, perhaps even more than people realize. Many of the greatest <u>scientific breakthroughs</u> in history started with someone imagining something that seemed impossible at the time. Einstein famously used <u>thought experiments</u> where he imagined riding on a beam of light, which helped him develop the theory of relativity. Scientists need imagination to form hypotheses, to ask 'what if' questions, and to envision possibilities that haven't been proven yet. Without imagination, science would just be about collecting data and following existing knowledge. The real <u>discoveries and innovations</u> come from scientists who can imagine new explanations, new technologies, or new ways of looking at problems. Of course, imagination alone isn't enough because scientists also need <u>rigorous testing and evidence</u>, but that creative spark is what drives progress forward."

        answer: "Oh, there are so many jobs that require imagination! The most obvious ones are in <u>creative industries</u> like advertising, design, film, music, writing, and the arts. These jobs literally depend on coming up with original ideas and expressing them in compelling ways. But imagination is also crucial in fields you might not immediately think of. <u>Entrepreneurs and business leaders</u> need imagination to spot opportunities and envision new products or services. Architects and engineers need it to design buildings and solutions that don't exist yet. Teachers need imagination to find engaging ways to explain difficult concepts. Even doctors sometimes need to <u>think creatively</u> when diagnosing unusual cases or developing treatment plans. Marketing professionals, product developers, chefs, event planners, and game designers all rely heavily on imagination too. Honestly, I'd say almost every job benefits from some level of creativity because problem-solving itself requires imagining different solutions."

        question: "What subjects are helpful for children's imagination?",
        answer: "I think several subjects can really help develop children's imagination. First and foremost, <u>art and music</u> are fantastic because they encourage children to express themselves freely and create something from nothing. There's no single right answer in art, which gives kids the freedom to explore. <u>Literature and creative writing</u> are also extremely valuable because reading stories transports children to different worlds and writing allows them to create their own. Drama and theater help children imagine being different characters in different situations. Interestingly, I also think <u>science</u> can be great for imagination when taught well, especially through experiments and discovery-based learning where children have to predict outcomes and ask questions. Even <u>history</u> can spark imagination by helping children picture life in different times and places. The key is how these subjects are taught. When teachers encourage exploration, questions, and creative thinking rather than just memorization, any subject can nurture imagination."

      {
        question: "What games help develop children's imagination?",
        answer: "There are lots of games that are wonderful for developing imagination in children. <u>Pretend play</u> or role-playing games are probably the best because children literally create scenarios, characters, and stories from their minds. This includes playing house, being superheroes, or pretending to be teachers or doctors. <u>Building toys</u> like Lego, blocks, or construction sets are excellent because they allow kids to imagine and create whatever they want. Art-based activities like drawing, painting, or making crafts also let children bring their inner visions to life. <u>Storytelling games</u> where children make up stories or continue narratives are great too. Board games that involve strategy or creating something can help as well. I'd also mention that <u>outdoor play</u> with minimal structure encourages imagination because children have to invent their own entertainment. On the other hand, I think it's worth noting that while some video games can be creative, many are quite passive and don't require much imagination since everything is already designed for you."

      {
        question: "How important is imagination to children?",
        answer: "I believe imagination is incredibly important for children, and it goes far beyond just having fun. First of all, imagination helps with <u>cognitive development</u>. When children imagine, they're actually exercising their brains, developing problem-solving skills, and learning to think abstractly. It also plays a huge role in <u>emotional development</u> because through imaginative play, children can process their feelings, work through fears, and understand different perspectives by pretending to be other people. Imagination is closely linked to <u>language development</u> too, as children who engage in pretend play often develop better vocabulary and communication skills. It's also the foundation of <u>creativity and innovation</u>, which will be valuable throughout their lives, whatever career they choose. Socially, imaginative play teaches children to cooperate, negotiate, and share when playing with others. I'd even say imagination helps children develop <u>resilience</u> because it allows them to envision positive outcomes and possibilities even in difficult situations. So really, it's not just important, it's essential for healthy development."

    answer: `The building I want to talk about is the central library in my city. I find it absolutely fascinating.

It's located right in the heart of the city centre, just a short walk from the main square. You really can't miss it because it <u>stands out</u> from all the other buildings around it.

In terms of appearance, the building is quite modern and <u>unconventional</u>. It's shaped a bit like a giant cube, but the exterior is covered in thousands of small metallic panels that reflect sunlight during the day. When the sun hits it, it almost looks like the building is <u>glowing or shimmering</u>. At night, there's this beautiful lighting system that makes the whole structure change colours. The entrance has these massive glass doors, and once you step inside, there's this incredible <u>open atrium</u> that goes all the way up to the roof, maybe six or seven floors high.

As for its function, well, it's primarily a public library, but it's so much more than that. There are traditional book collections, of course, but also <u>digital media centres</u>, study rooms, a small cinema for documentaries, exhibition spaces, and even a rooftop café with amazing views of the city.

What makes it interesting to me is how it <u>challenges the idea</u> of what a library should look like. When you think of a library, you probably imagine a quiet, old-fashioned building with dusty shelves. But this one feels more like a <u>community hub</u> where people of all ages come to learn, work, and socialise. I also love how the architects managed to create such a <u>striking design</u> while still making it functional and welcoming. Every time I visit, I notice something new, whether it's a clever design detail or how the natural light comes through the panels. It really shows that <u>public buildings</u> don't have to be boring.`,

        question: "What types of buildings are popular in your country?",
        answer: "Well, it really varies depending on the area. In big cities, <u>high-rise apartments</u> and modern office towers are extremely common because land is expensive and space is limited. You see a lot of glass and steel structures going up everywhere. In suburban areas, <u>detached houses</u> with gardens are more popular, especially among families who want more space. Shopping centres and malls are also very popular because people like having everything in one place. In recent years, there's been a growing trend towards <u>mixed-use developments</u> that combine residential, commercial, and recreational spaces.

        question: "Is it worth spending a lot of money on the exterior appearance of a building?",

For <u>landmark buildings</u> like museums, concert halls, or government buildings, I'd say yes, it's worth investing in the exterior because these buildings represent the city or country and become part of its identity. A beautiful building can attract tourists and <u>boost local pride</u>. However, for regular residential or office buildings, I think there needs to be a balance. Spending excessive amounts on fancy exteriors while neglecting the interior or structural quality doesn't make much sense. What's the point of a gorgeous façade if the building is uncomfortable to live or work in? I think a reasonable approach is to create something <u>aesthetically pleasing</u> without going overboard, and make sure the money spent actually adds value for the people using the building."
      },
      {
        question: "Is it more important for a building to look good on the outside or on the inside?",
        answer: "If I had to choose, I'd say the inside is more important, and here's why. The interior is where people actually <u>spend their time</u>. You might admire a beautiful exterior for a few seconds as you walk past, but you could spend hours or even years inside a building if you live or work there. Comfort, functionality, natural lighting, and good ventilation are things that directly affect people's <u>well-being and productivity</u>. That said, I don't think it has to be an either-or situation. Ideally, good architects should be able to create buildings that look great both inside and out. The exterior is like your <u>first impression</u>, and it does matter because it affects the overall character of a neighbourhood.

        question: "Why do people like to visit historical sites?",
        answer: "I think there are several reasons why people are drawn to historical sites. For many, it's about <u>connecting with the past</u> and trying to understand how people lived in different eras. Standing in a place where significant events happened gives you a sense of perspective that you just can't get from reading books or watching documentaries. There's also an <u>educational aspect</u> because visiting these places helps people learn about history, culture, and architecture in a much more engaging way. Some people visit for the <u>aesthetic value</u> since many historical buildings are simply beautiful and showcase incredible craftsmanship that's hard to find today. For others, it's about <u>cultural identity</u> and feeling connected to their heritage or roots. And let's be honest, historical sites are often located in interesting places, so they become natural tourist attractions. I also think there's something almost <u>magical</u> about walking the same streets or standing in the same rooms where famous historical figures once stood."

      {
        question: "Do you think it's reasonable to charge an entry fee for visiting interesting buildings?",
        answer: "Yes, in most cases I think it's perfectly reasonable. Maintaining and preserving historic or architecturally significant buildings <u>costs a lot of money</u>. You need staff, security, cleaning, repairs, and restoration work. If there's no entry fee, that money has to come from somewhere, usually taxpayers. So charging visitors makes sense, especially for tourists who benefit from seeing these places. However, I do think fees should be <u>kept affordable</u> so that everyone can access them, not just wealthy people. Some places offer <u>discounted rates</u> for students, seniors, or local residents, which I think is a good approach. I also appreciate when museums or buildings have free entry days so that people who can't normally afford it get a chance to visit. The only situation where I'm not sure about fees is when it comes to <u>religious or sacred buildings</u> that people want to visit for worship rather than tourism. In those cases, it feels a bit uncomfortable to charge."

        question: "Is it better to live in a new building or an old one?",
        answer: "That's a tough one because both have their advantages and disadvantages. New buildings generally offer better <u>energy efficiency</u>, modern amenities, and they're built to current safety standards. Things like heating, plumbing, and electrical systems are all up to date, which means fewer problems and lower maintenance costs. The layouts tend to be more practical for modern lifestyles too. On the other hand, older buildings often have more <u>character and charm</u>. They might have higher ceilings, original features like fireplaces or decorative mouldings, and they're built with materials you don't see much anymore. Some people really value that sense of <u>history and uniqueness</u>. The downsides of old buildings include potential issues like poor insulation, outdated wiring, and expensive repairs. Personally, I think it comes down to individual preferences and priorities. If you value <u>convenience and efficiency</u>, go for new. If you love character and don't mind some extra maintenance, old buildings can be wonderful. I'd probably choose something in between, like a well-renovated older building that has modern systems but keeps its original charm."

    answer: `Actually, there's a film I watched just a couple of weeks ago that I really enjoyed. It was called "The Shawshank Redemption," and even though it's an older movie from the 90s, it was my first time watching it.

I watched it at home on a Saturday evening. I'd just finished a really hectic week at work, so I wanted to <u>unwind</u> and have a relaxing night in. I watched it with my older brother, who had seen it years ago and kept telling me I absolutely had to watch it.

The movie is about a banker named Andy who gets <u>wrongfully convicted</u> of murdering his wife and her lover. He's sent to Shawshank prison, where he spends nearly two decades. The story follows his friendship with another prisoner called Red, and how Andy manages to <u>maintain hope</u> and dignity despite the brutal prison conditions. Without giving away too much, there's an incredible twist at the end that I honestly didn't see coming.

The reason I finally watched it was because my brother had been <u>recommending it for ages</u>, and it always appears on those "best movies of all time" lists. I was curious to see if it lived up to the hype, and honestly, it exceeded my expectations. The storytelling was <u>absolutely gripping</u>, and the message about hope and perseverance really <u>resonated with me</u>. I actually felt quite emotional by the end. It reminded me why I love cinema so much, because a great film can really <u>touch your heart</u> and stay with you long after the credits roll.`,

People love that kind of entertainment, particularly younger audiences. <u>Comedies</u> also do very well because everyone enjoys a good laugh, and local comedies that reflect our culture and humor tend to be especially successful. In recent years, there's been a growing appetite for <u>high-quality dramas</u> that tell meaningful stories and tackle social issues. Romantic films are popular too, particularly around Valentine's Day or holiday seasons. I've also noticed that movies based on <u>true stories or historical events</u> attract a lot of viewers because people find them fascinating and educational. And of course, animated films do brilliantly because they appeal to families and children. Overall, I'd say movies that combine good storytelling with entertainment value tend to succeed regardless of genre."

        question: "What are the factors that make a successful movie?",
        answer: "I think several factors contribute to making a movie successful. First and foremost, you need a <u>compelling story</u>. No matter how good the actors or special effects are, if the story is weak or predictable, audiences won't connect with it. Strong <u>character development</u> is also crucial because viewers need to care about the characters and what happens to them. Good acting brings these characters to life, so having talented performers matters a lot. <u>Direction</u> is another key factor because the director's vision shapes how the story is told visually and emotionally. Technical elements like cinematography, music, and editing can really elevate a film too. Marketing and <u>timing of release</u> also play important roles in commercial success. And honestly, sometimes there's an element of luck involved, like whether the movie captures the cultural moment or becomes a talking point on social media. Word of mouth can make or break a film these days."

        question: "Do Chinese people prefer to watch domestic movies or foreign movies?",
        answer: "I think it's quite <u>balanced</u> nowadays, though there's been a noticeable shift in recent years. Traditionally, Hollywood blockbusters were extremely popular, and people would flock to cinemas to watch the latest American action films or superhero movies. However, domestic Chinese cinema has <u>improved dramatically</u> in terms of production quality and storytelling. Films like Wolf Warrior and The Wandering Earth have broken box office records, showing that audiences are very willing to support local productions when they're well-made. I think many people appreciate domestic films because they <u>reflect Chinese culture</u>, values, and experiences in ways that foreign films can't. The humor, the family dynamics, and the social issues feel more relatable. That said, foreign films still have a strong following, especially among younger people who enjoy Hollywood entertainment and Korean dramas. I'd say most people enjoy both and choose based on what looks interesting rather than strictly preferring one over the other."

        question: "Do you think only well-known directors can create the best movies?",
        answer: "No, I don't think that's true at all. While established directors certainly have advantages like bigger budgets, industry connections, and creative freedom, some of the most <u>innovative and memorable</u> films have come from newcomers or lesser-known filmmakers. History is full of examples where a director's debut film became a classic. Fresh perspectives can actually be an advantage because new directors aren't bound by <u>conventions or expectations</u>. They might take risks that more established directors wouldn't. Of course, experience does help, and well-known directors have usually earned their reputation for a reason. They understand the craft deeply and know how to <u>manage large productions</u>. But talent and vision aren't limited to famous names. With today's technology making filmmaking more accessible, we're seeing amazing work from independent directors all over the world. I think what matters most is the director's <u>passion, creativity, and storytelling ability</u>, not their fame."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you think successful movies should have well-known actors or actresses in leading roles?",
        answer: "Not necessarily. While having famous actors can definitely help with <u>marketing and publicity</u>, it doesn't guarantee a movie's success or quality. There are plenty of examples where films with unknown actors became huge hits because the story and performances were so strong. Sometimes casting fresh faces actually works better because audiences don't have <u>preconceived notions</u> about them, making it easier to believe in the character. On the other hand, star power can attract audiences who might not otherwise watch a particular type of film, and experienced actors bring valuable skills and professionalism. I think the most important thing is <u>casting the right person</u> for each role, whether they're famous or not. A well-known actor who's miscast can actually hurt a film, while an unknown who perfectly embodies a character can make it unforgettable. Some of the best performances I've seen have been from actors I'd never heard of before watching that particular movie."

        question: "Why do people prefer to watch movies in the cinema?",
        answer: "There are several reasons why the cinema experience remains popular despite all the streaming options available. The most obvious one is the <u>immersive experience</u>. The massive screen, the surround sound system, and the dark environment create an atmosphere you simply can't replicate at home. For action films or visually stunning movies, watching on a big screen makes a huge difference. There's also the <u>social aspect</u> of going to the cinema. It's a popular activity for dates, family outings, or hanging out with friends. You share the experience with others, and there's something special about laughing or gasping together with a whole audience. The cinema also provides <u>escape and focus</u>. When you're at home, there are so many distractions like your phone, household tasks, or other people. At the cinema, you're committed to watching the film without interruptions. For some people, it's also about the <u>ritual and nostalgia</u> of buying popcorn, seeing trailers, and experiencing movies the way they've been enjoyed for over a century."

    answer: `Okay, so this was a few months ago when I went to a friend's wedding reception. It was quite an <u>awkward experience</u> music-wise, to be honest.

The wedding was at a fancy hotel in the city centre. I went with a couple of my university friends because the bride was someone we all knew from our course. We were really excited to attend and celebrate with her.

The reason I went was obviously to <u>support my friend</u> on her big day. Weddings are such important occasions, and I wouldn't miss it for anything. Plus, it had been a while since our group got together, so it was also a chance to <u>catch up</u> with everyone.

Now, the music situation was a bit unfortunate. The couple had hired a DJ who played almost exclusively heavy metal and hard rock music throughout the entire reception. I mean, I have nothing against those genres, but it just didn't fit the <u>atmosphere</u> at all. Most of the guests were older family members and people who clearly weren't into that kind of music. The volume was also <u>way too loud</u>, making it impossible to have conversations without shouting.

I think what made it worse was that there was <u>no variety</u>. At most weddings, you get a mix of different songs so everyone can enjoy something. But this was just non-stop heavy guitar riffs and screaming vocals. A lot of people left the dance floor empty, and you could see some of the elderly guests looking quite uncomfortable. Honestly, I spent most of the evening outside in the garden area just to <u>escape the noise</u>. It's a shame because everything else about the wedding was lovely.`,

        question: "What kind of music events do people like today?",
        answer: "From what I can see, people today enjoy a really <u>wide variety</u> of music events. Music festivals have become hugely popular, especially among younger people. These big outdoor events that run for several days and feature multiple artists are like a whole experience, not just about the music but also the atmosphere, camping, and socialising. Concerts by popular artists always sell out quickly, whether it's pop stars, rock bands, or hip-hop artists. Smaller, more <u>intimate events</u> like jazz nights or acoustic sessions in bars and cafes have their dedicated following too. I've also noticed that themed music nights at clubs, like 80s nights or Latin music evenings, attract quite a crowd. Electronic music events and DJ sets remain popular for those who enjoy dancing. And there's been a growing interest in <u>classical music concerts</u> and opera among certain groups, which is nice to see. So really, there's something for everyone."

        question: "Do you think children should receive some musical education?",
        answer: "Yes, absolutely. I think musical education is really <u>beneficial for children</u> in many ways. First of all, learning music helps with <u>cognitive development</u>. Studies have shown that children who learn to play instruments or read music often do better in subjects like maths because music involves patterns, counting, and structure. It also improves memory and concentration. Beyond academics, music allows children to <u>express themselves creatively</u> and can be a great emotional outlet. Learning an instrument teaches discipline, patience, and the value of practice. It can also boost confidence, especially when children perform in front of others. Even if a child doesn't become a professional musician, having some musical knowledge enriches their life and helps them <u>appreciate music</u> more deeply. I think schools should definitely include music in their curriculum, and parents should encourage their children to explore instruments or singing if they show interest."

        question: "What are the differences between old and young people's music preferences?",
        answer: "Well, there are definitely some noticeable differences, though I think it's important not to <u>generalise too much</u>. Generally speaking, younger people tend to prefer more contemporary genres like pop, hip-hop, electronic dance music, and whatever's currently trending on social media or streaming platforms. They're often more open to <u>experimental sounds</u> and new artists. Older generations typically prefer the music they grew up with, so you'll find many who still love classic rock, jazz, folk, or traditional music from their culture. There's also a difference in how they <u>consume music</u>. Young people mostly stream everything and discover new music through algorithms and playlists, while older people might still buy albums or listen to radio stations. That said, I know plenty of older people who enjoy current music and young people who love classics, so musical taste is really <u>individual</u>. One interesting thing is that concerts by older artists often have quite mixed-age audiences."

These can be anything from rock and pop festivals to electronic music events. In cities, there are concerts happening almost every week at venues of all sizes, from small clubs to large arenas. <u>Traditional music events</u> are also popular, especially during cultural celebrations and holidays, where you can hear folk music and traditional instruments. Jazz clubs and bars with live music are common in urban areas. Classical music has its place too, with orchestras performing at concert halls and sometimes outdoor venues during special occasions. There are also <u>community events</u> like local band competitions, open mic nights, and street performances in busy areas. During religious festivals, there are often musical performances as part of the celebrations. So whether you're into mainstream pop or niche genres, you can usually find something."

        question: "Why do many people like listening to music while doing sports?",
        answer: "Oh, there are several good reasons for this. First and most importantly, music is a great <u>motivator</u>. An upbeat song with a strong rhythm can really push you to work harder and keep going when you're feeling tired. It gives you that extra energy boost. Music also helps people <u>maintain a steady pace</u>, especially during activities like running or cycling. You naturally sync your movements to the beat, which can actually improve performance. Another big reason is that music provides a <u>distraction from discomfort</u>. When you're exercising, especially doing something intense, focusing on a song takes your mind off the physical strain and makes the workout feel easier and shorter. For many people, putting on their workout playlist also <u>signals mentally</u> that it's time to exercise, helping them get into the right mindset. And let's be honest, working out can sometimes be boring, so music makes it more enjoyable. It transforms exercise from a chore into something you actually look forward to."

      {
        question: "What are the differences between listening to music at home and at a live concert?",
        answer: "The experiences are really quite different. At home, you have complete <u>control and comfort</u>. You can listen to whatever you want, skip songs, adjust the volume, and do it all while relaxing on your sofa in your pyjamas. It's convenient and private. But a live concert offers something you just can't replicate at home, which is the <u>atmosphere and energy</u>. Being surrounded by thousands of people who share your love for an artist, singing along together, feeling the bass vibrate through your body, it's incredibly exciting. There's also the <u>visual spectacle</u> of a concert with lights, stage design, and seeing the artists perform in person. Live performances often include improvisation or different arrangements, making each show unique. The <u>emotional connection</u> feels stronger when you're actually there. On the downside, concerts can be expensive, crowded, and you might not get a good view or sound quality. At home, the audio quality is consistent, and you can listen anytime. I think both experiences have their place, and one doesn't replace the other."

    answer: `Let me tell you about my friend David, who taught himself how to play the guitar completely on his own.

David is one of my closest friends from secondary school. We've known each other for about twelve years now. He works as an accountant, so music has nothing to do with his job, it's purely a <u>passion project</u> for him.

What he learned was playing acoustic guitar, and he's actually become really good at it. He can play all sorts of songs, from pop to rock to classical pieces. He even writes his own music sometimes, which I find <u>really impressive</u>.

The reason he decided to learn was pretty simple. He'd always loved music and wanted to be able to play his favourite songs himself. He couldn't afford proper lessons at the time, and his work schedule was too unpredictable to commit to regular classes anyway. So he just decided to <u>figure it out himself</u>.

He used a combination of YouTube tutorials, online courses, and lots of practice. He'd spend hours watching videos, pausing and rewinding to get the finger positions right. He also used apps that slow down songs so he could learn them <u>bit by bit</u>.

As for whether it would be easier with a teacher, I think it definitely would be in some ways. A teacher can correct your mistakes immediately, give you <u>structured guidance</u>, and help you avoid developing bad habits. David admits he probably learned some things the wrong way initially and had to unlearn them later. But he also says that <u>self-learning</u> made him more resourceful and determined. He had to solve problems on his own, which gave him a deeper understanding. So while a teacher might make things faster and easier, learning independently has its own rewards.`,

        question: "Is it necessary to keep learning after graduating from school?",
        answer: "Absolutely, I think <u>lifelong learning</u> is essential in today's world. The reality is that the knowledge we gain in school becomes outdated pretty quickly, especially with how fast technology and industries are changing. If you stop learning after graduation, you risk falling behind in your career and becoming <u>less competitive</u> in the job market. Beyond professional reasons, continuing to learn keeps your mind sharp and engaged. It can be anything from taking courses to reading books to learning new hobbies. I've seen people who stopped challenging themselves intellectually, and they often seem less adaptable and open-minded. Learning also brings <u>personal satisfaction</u> and can open doors to new interests and opportunities you never expected.

        question: "Should teachers make learning in their classes fun?",
        answer: "Yes, I really believe they should, whenever possible. When learning is enjoyable, students are much more <u>engaged and motivated</u>. They actually want to pay attention and participate, rather than counting down the minutes until class ends. Fun doesn't mean there's no substance though. A good teacher can make even difficult subjects interesting through creative teaching methods, real-world examples, interactive activities, or humour. Students tend to <u>remember things better</u> when they're associated with positive experiences. Of course, not every single moment of learning can be entertaining, and students also need to understand that some things require discipline and hard work even when they're not fun. But overall, a classroom where students enjoy being is going to produce <u>better outcomes</u> than one where everyone is bored and disengaged. Teachers who can make learning fun are really valuable."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you think there are too many subjects for students to learn?",
        answer: "Hmm, that's a tricky question. In some ways, yes, I do think students today are <u>overloaded</u> with subjects, especially in certain education systems. They have to study everything from languages to sciences to arts to physical education, and the pressure to perform well in all of them can be overwhelming. This doesn't leave much time for <u>deep exploration</u> of subjects they're actually passionate about. On the other hand, a broad curriculum ensures students get exposure to different fields before they specialise, which helps them discover what they're good at and interested in. The problem isn't necessarily the number of subjects but rather the <u>depth and expectations</u>. If students are expected to excel at everything, that's unrealistic and stressful. I think a balance is needed where core subjects are covered well, but students also have some flexibility to <u>focus on their strengths</u> and interests."
      },
      {
        question: "Is it better to focus on a few subjects or to learn many subjects?",
        answer: "I think it depends on the stage of education and the individual's goals. For younger students, learning many subjects makes sense because they're still <u>discovering their interests</u> and abilities. Exposure to different areas helps them figure out what they enjoy and what they're naturally good at. However, as students get older, especially in higher education and career preparation, focusing on fewer subjects more deeply becomes more valuable. You can't become truly skilled at something if your attention is spread too thin. That said, I also believe in the value of being a <u>well-rounded person</u>. Even specialists benefit from having some knowledge outside their field. It helps with creativity and problem-solving. So my view is that there should be a progression from broader learning when young to more <u>focused specialisation</u> as you mature, while still maintaining some general knowledge and curiosity about other areas."

        question: "Do you think enterprises should provide training for their employees?",
        answer: "Definitely, yes. I think it's a <u>win-win situation</u> for both the company and the employees. For companies, providing training ensures their workforce stays up-to-date with the latest skills, technologies, and industry practices. This improves productivity, quality of work, and helps the company stay competitive. It's also much cheaper to <u>upskill existing employees</u> than to constantly hire new people. For employees, training opportunities are highly valued. It helps them grow professionally, feel more confident in their roles, and see a future with the company. This increases <u>job satisfaction and loyalty</u>, reducing turnover. Companies that invest in their people tend to have better workplace cultures too. Some might argue it's a waste if trained employees leave, but I think that's short-sighted. The benefits of having a skilled, motivated workforce far outweigh the risks. Plus, companies that are known for developing their staff actually attract better talent."

        question: "Do you think it is good for older adults to continue learning?",
        answer: "Yes, definitely. Continuing to learn in later life has so many benefits. First, there's the <u>mental health aspect</u>. Studies show that keeping the brain active through learning can help delay cognitive decline and reduce the risk of conditions like dementia. It keeps the mind sharp and engaged. Beyond health, learning gives older adults a <u>sense of purpose</u> and achievement. Retirement can sometimes feel empty when the structure of work disappears, so having something to learn provides goals and daily motivation. It also opens up opportunities for <u>social connection</u>, whether through classes, clubs, or online communities. Many older adults discover new passions or finally have time to pursue interests they couldn't before. Whether it's learning a language, picking up a musical instrument, studying history, or even getting a degree, it's never too late. I find it really inspiring when I see older people in classes or learning new technologies. It shows that age doesn't have to limit us."

    answer: `Someone who really impressed me with their clever thinking is my colleague, Tom. He works in our IT department, and last year he came up with a brilliant solution to a problem that had been frustrating everyone for months.

The problem was with our company's internal filing system. We had thousands of documents scattered across different folders, and finding anything was a <u>complete nightmare</u>. People were wasting hours every week searching for files, and sometimes important documents just got lost entirely. The management wanted to hire an expensive consultant to reorganize everything, which would have cost a fortune.

Tom volunteered to tackle it instead. What he did was really clever. Rather than manually sorting through everything, which would have taken forever, he created a simple search tool using some coding skills he'd taught himself. But the smart part was how he designed it. He added a <u>tagging system</u> where people could add keywords to files as they used them. So every time someone opened a document, they'd spend just a few seconds tagging it. Within a couple of months, the most frequently used files were all properly organized through <u>collective effort</u>, without anyone having to do a massive reorganization project.

I think this was smart for several reasons. First, he identified the <u>root cause</u> of the problem, which wasn't just messy files but the lack of a sustainable system. Second, he found a solution that was <u>low-cost and efficient</u>, using skills he already had. Third, and this is what I found most clever, he made the solution <u>self-improving</u>. The more people used it, the better it got. Instead of creating extra work, he distributed the effort so nobody was burdened. That kind of thinking is what separates truly smart problem-solvers from people who just work hard.`,

        question: "Do you think children are born smart or they learn to become smart?",
        answer: "I think it's a combination of both, really. Some children are definitely born with certain <u>natural abilities</u> or a higher potential in specific areas. You can see this in how some kids pick up languages or maths more easily than others from a very young age. However, I believe that environment and education play an equally important, if not more important, role. A child with natural potential who doesn't receive proper stimulation, encouragement, or educational opportunities might never fully develop their abilities. On the other hand, children who are supported, challenged, and taught good <u>learning habits</u> can achieve remarkable things even without exceptional natural talent. I've seen hardworking students outperform naturally gifted ones because they developed better study skills and persistence. So while genetics give us a starting point, what we do with that potential through <u>learning and practice</u> is what really determines how smart we become."
      },
      {
        question: "How do children become smart at school?",
        answer: "There are several factors that help children develop their intelligence at school. First, having <u>good teachers</u> who can explain things clearly and make learning engaging is crucial. Teachers who inspire curiosity and encourage questions help children think more deeply. The learning environment matters too, meaning a classroom where children feel safe to make mistakes and learn from them. <u>Active participation</u> is important because children learn better when they're involved rather than just passively listening. Developing good study habits like regular revision, taking notes, and staying organized helps a lot. I also think being exposed to <u>diverse subjects and activities</u> stretches their minds in different ways. Social interaction with peers can stimulate thinking through discussions and group work. And of course, support from home reinforces what's learned at school. Children whose parents show interest in their education and encourage reading tend to do better. It's really a combination of good teaching, personal effort, and a supportive environment."

Some people have what you might call <u>diverse curiosity</u>. They're naturally interested in many different things and enjoy learning about various subjects. They might also have more opportunities or encouragement to explore different areas. Others find one thing they're truly passionate about and decide to <u>dedicate themselves fully</u> to it. There's nothing wrong with this because deep expertise in one area can lead to great achievements. Personality plays a role too. Some people enjoy variety and get bored focusing on one thing, while others prefer depth over breadth. The education system and culture also influence this. Some systems encourage well-roundedness while others push for early specialisation. I don't think one approach is better than the other, to be honest. Society needs both <u>generalists</u> who can connect different fields and <u>specialists</u> who push the boundaries of specific areas."

        question: "Why does modern society need talents of all kinds?",
        answer: "Modern society is incredibly complex, and no single type of talent can address all its needs. We need scientists and engineers to drive <u>technological innovation</u>, but we also need artists and musicians to enrich our cultural lives. We need doctors and nurses, but also teachers and social workers. We need people who are brilliant at analytical thinking, but also those who excel at <u>creative problem-solving</u> or emotional intelligence. Different challenges require different skills. Climate change, for example, needs scientists to understand it, engineers to develop solutions, communicators to raise awareness, and politicians to implement policies. If everyone had the same talents, we'd have huge gaps in society. There's also the economic aspect. A diverse economy needs people with diverse skills, from craftspeople to coders, from farmers to financial analysts. I think recognizing and valuing <u>all types of talents</u> equally is important for a healthy society. Not everyone needs to be a doctor or lawyer to be valuable."

        question: "Do you think smart children are happier than other children?",
        answer: "Not necessarily, and actually sometimes it can be the opposite. Being intellectually gifted can come with its own challenges. Smart children might feel <u>different or isolated</u> from their peers if they're interested in things other kids aren't. They might get bored easily in regular classes and become frustrated or disengaged. Some gifted children face high expectations from parents and teachers, which creates <u>pressure and anxiety</u>. They might also overthink things and worry more than other children. That said, intelligence can contribute to happiness in some ways. Being able to understand the world, solve problems, and achieve academic success can be satisfying. But happiness depends on so many other factors like having loving relationships, feeling accepted, having fun, and developing emotional intelligence. A child who is average academically but has great friends, supportive family, and enjoys their hobbies might be much happier than a genius who feels lonely or pressured. <u>Emotional well-being</u> matters more than IQ for happiness."
      },
      {
        question: "Is it important for schools to identify and develop each student's talents?",
        answer: "Yes, I believe this is really important. Every child has <u>unique strengths and abilities</u>, and a good education system should help them discover and develop these. When schools only focus on academic subjects and test scores, many talented children get overlooked. A child who struggles with maths might be an incredible artist, musician, or athlete, but if those talents aren't recognized, they might feel like failures when they're actually gifted in their own way. Identifying talents early allows schools to <u>provide appropriate support and opportunities</u>. This could mean advanced classes for academically gifted students, or art programs for creative ones, or sports training for athletic children. It also helps with motivation because children are more engaged when learning aligns with their interests and strengths. However, this needs to be balanced. Schools shouldn't <u>label children too early</u> or limit their options based on perceived talents. Children change and develop, and they should still get a well-rounded education. The goal should be to nurture individual talents while ensuring everyone has basic skills and knowledge."

    answer: `There's a road trip I've been dreaming about for years, and I'd love to finally make it happen. I want to drive along the coastal highway in my country, all the way from the north to the south.

I'd like to go with my two closest friends from university. We've always talked about doing a <u>proper adventure</u> together, but with everyone's work schedules and responsibilities, it's been hard to find the right time. The three of us share a love for exploring new places, and I think we'd have an amazing time together.

The plan would be to travel along the coast, stopping at different towns and beaches along the way. I've seen so many beautiful photos of <u>hidden coves</u>, dramatic cliffs, and charming fishing villages that I've never actually visited. The whole trip would probably take about two weeks if we want to do it properly without rushing.

I'd love to go in autumn, maybe October or November. The weather would still be pleasant but not too hot, and most tourists would be gone, so we'd have more peaceful experiences. Plus, the autumn colours along the coastline would be absolutely <u>stunning</u>.

The reason I want to do this by car rather than flying or taking trains is because a road trip offers so much <u>freedom and flexibility</u>. You can stop whenever you see something interesting, take detours to unexpected places, and really experience the journey itself, not just the destinations. There's something special about driving with good music playing, having conversations with friends, and watching the <u>landscape gradually change</u> outside the window. Flying would get us there faster, but we'd miss all that. I think the journey is just as important as the destination, and a road trip captures that perfectly.`,

        question: "Which form of vehicle is more popular in your country, bikes, cars or motorcycles?",
        answer: "In my country, cars are definitely the most popular form of vehicle, especially in cities and suburban areas. Car ownership has increased dramatically over the past few decades as people have become more <u>affluent</u> and roads have improved. Most families consider having at least one car essential for daily life. Motorcycles are quite popular too, particularly in smaller cities and rural areas where they're more practical for <u>navigating narrow streets</u> and more affordable to buy and maintain. They're also common among younger people and delivery workers. Bicycles have seen a bit of a revival recently, especially in major cities where bike-sharing schemes have been introduced and dedicated cycling lanes have been built. More people are cycling for <u>health and environmental reasons</u>. But overall, cars remain dominant because they offer comfort, convenience, and status. The preference really varies by location though, with urban areas having more transport options than rural regions."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you think air pollution comes mostly from mobile vehicles?",
        answer: "Vehicles are certainly a <u>major contributor</u> to air pollution, but I don't think they're the only significant source. In urban areas, yes, cars, trucks, and motorcycles produce a huge amount of emissions, including carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. Rush hour traffic in big cities creates visible smog and poor air quality. However, we shouldn't overlook other sources. <u>Industrial activities</u> like factories and power plants, especially those burning coal, contribute enormously to pollution. Construction and mining create dust and emissions too. In some regions, agricultural burning and domestic heating with coal or wood are major factors. The balance varies by location. In heavily industrialized areas, factories might be the main culprit, while in cities with lots of vehicles but few factories, transport is the bigger issue. I think addressing air pollution requires tackling <u>all these sources</u>, not just focusing on vehicles. Though transitioning to electric vehicles and improving public transport would certainly help a lot."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you think people need to change the way of transportation drastically to protect the environment?",
        answer: "Yes, I think significant changes are necessary, though perhaps not overnight. Our current reliance on <u>petrol and diesel vehicles</u> is clearly unsustainable given climate change and air pollution. The good news is that alternatives exist. Electric vehicles are becoming more affordable and practical. Public transport can move many people efficiently with lower emissions per person. Cycling and walking are zero-emission options for shorter distances. However, I think the changes need to be <u>gradual and practical</u>. People won't abandon their cars if there's no reliable alternative, so governments need to invest in better public transport, charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, and safe cycling routes. Making sustainable choices more convenient and affordable is key. I don't think we need to ban all private vehicles or force people onto buses, but we do need to shift the balance. Cities that have invested in excellent <u>public transport and cycling infrastructure</u> show it's possible to reduce car dependency while maintaining quality of life. It requires planning and investment, but it's definitely achievable."
      },
      {
        question: "How are the transportation systems in urban areas and rural areas different?",
        answer: "The differences are quite significant actually. Urban areas typically have <u>diverse transport options</u>. You have buses, underground trains or metros, trams, taxis, ride-sharing services, and increasingly bike-sharing schemes. Distances are shorter, so walking is often practical. Traffic congestion pushes people towards public transport, and parking can be expensive or limited. Rural areas are completely different. Public transport is often <u>limited or non-existent</u>. You might have a bus that comes once or twice a day, if you're lucky. There's no metro or tram, few taxis, and ride-sharing apps might not operate there. Distances between places are much greater, making walking impractical. As a result, people in rural areas are far more <u>dependent on private cars</u>. This creates challenges for those who can't drive or afford a car, like elderly people or teenagers. The infrastructure differs too. Urban roads are more developed but congested, while rural roads might be smaller and less maintained. I think this <u>transport inequality</u> is something that needs more attention."
      },
      {
        question: "Why do more people own and drive private cars now?",
        answer: "There are several reasons for the increase in car ownership. First, economic growth has made cars more <u>affordable for average families</u>. What was once a luxury item is now seen as a necessity by many. Cars have also become cheaper to produce, and financing options make purchasing easier. Second, cars offer unmatched <u>convenience and flexibility</u>. You can go wherever you want, whenever you want, without waiting for buses or trains. This is especially valuable for families with children, people with mobility issues, or those living in areas with poor public transport. Third, there's a <u>status element</u>. In many cultures, owning a car, particularly a nice one, is seen as a sign of success. Fourth, urban expansion has created suburbs where public transport doesn't reach well, making cars essential. Finally, modern life often requires juggling multiple activities like dropping kids at school, going to work, shopping, attending appointments, and a car makes managing all this much easier. Unfortunately, this growth in car ownership has come with negative consequences like congestion and pollution."
      },
      {
        question: "What do you think of the future of electric cars?",
        answer: "I'm quite optimistic about electric cars, honestly. I think they're going to become the <u>standard form of vehicle</u> within the next couple of decades. The technology is improving rapidly. Batteries are getting better, offering longer ranges and shorter charging times. Prices are coming down as production scales up, making electric cars affordable for more people. Many governments are setting targets to <u>phase out petrol and diesel vehicles</u>, which will accelerate the transition. Major car manufacturers are investing heavily in electric models. Infrastructure is expanding too, with more charging stations appearing in cities, shopping centres, and along highways. Of course, there are still challenges. Charging infrastructure in rural areas needs improvement. The electricity used to charge cars should ideally come from <u>renewable sources</u> to maximize environmental benefits. Battery production and disposal raise environmental concerns that need addressing. And the upfront cost is still higher than traditional cars. But I believe these issues will be solved over time. Electric cars are quieter, cheaper to run, and better for air quality. I think my children will probably wonder why anyone ever drove petrol cars."

      "And explain why it is important to your family"
    ],
    answer: `In my family, we have an old wooden clock that has been passed down through <u>four generations</u> now. It's become something really special to all of us.

The clock has been in our family since my great-grandfather's time, so we're talking about roughly ninety years or so. It's a beautiful piece with intricate <u>carved details</u> on the wooden frame and a lovely painted face with Roman numerals. It still works perfectly, which is remarkable given its age. You have to wind it up manually every week, which feels like a nice little ritual.

My great-grandfather actually made it himself. He was a carpenter by trade, and apparently he crafted this clock as a <u>wedding gift</u> for my great-grandmother when they got married in the 1930s. He spent months working on it, carving all the decorative elements by hand. The story goes that he proposed to her by presenting this clock and promising her that their love would last as long as it kept ticking.

This clock is important to our family for several reasons. First, it's a <u>tangible connection</u> to ancestors most of us never had the chance to meet. When I look at it, I'm looking at something my great-grandfather created with his own hands, and that feels incredibly meaningful. Second, it represents the values we cherish as a family, like craftsmanship, dedication, and <u>enduring love</u>. Third, it's survived wars, house moves, and nearly a century of life, so it's witnessed our entire family history in a way. Every time it chimes, it's the same sound my grandparents and great-grandparents heard. My parents have already said it will pass to me one day, and I hope to eventually pass it to my own children. It's not valuable in a monetary sense, but its <u>sentimental worth</u> is priceless.`,
    part3Questions: [
      {
        question: "What things do families keep for a long time?",
        answer: "Families tend to keep items that have <u>sentimental value</u> rather than just monetary worth. Jewellery is very common, like wedding rings, necklaces, or watches that get passed down through generations. Photographs and photo albums are treasured because they capture memories and show family history visually. Important documents like birth certificates, old letters, or military records are often preserved carefully. Furniture can be kept for generations too, especially handcrafted pieces like wooden tables, chairs, or cabinets that were made to last. Some families keep <u>cultural or religious items</u> like special ceremonial objects, scriptures, or traditional clothing. China sets, silverware, and other items used for special occasions often become heirlooms. Personal items belonging to deceased loved ones, even simple things like a favourite book or tool, are kept for their emotional connection. What families choose to keep really reflects what they <u>value and want to remember</u>. It's rarely about how expensive something is."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between things valued by people in the past and today?",
        answer: "There's been quite a shift in what people value. In the past, people tended to value things that were <u>durable and practical</u>. Items were made to last, repaired when broken, and passed down to the next generation. Quality craftsmanship was highly appreciated, and people took pride in owning fewer but better things. Handmade items carried special significance. Today, we live in more of a <u>disposable culture</u>. Many people value newness and trendiness over longevity. Fast fashion, the latest technology, and constantly upgrading possessions have become normal. Things are often replaced rather than repaired. However, I think there's also a growing counter-movement where people are rediscovering the value of <u>sustainability and quality</u>. Vintage and antique items have become fashionable. Some people are rejecting consumerism and embracing minimalism. Another difference is that today, people often value <u>experiences over possessions</u>, spending money on travel, dining, and events rather than accumulating things. So while mainstream culture has shifted toward disposability, there's also a returning appreciation for what lasts."
      },
      {
        question: "What kinds of things are kept in museums?",
        answer: "Museums keep an incredibly <u>diverse range of items</u> depending on their focus. Art museums preserve paintings, sculptures, photographs, and other artistic works from different periods and cultures. History museums keep artifacts that tell the story of human civilization, like ancient tools, weapons, documents, clothing, and everyday objects from different eras. Natural history museums have fossils, preserved specimens, minerals, and displays about ecosystems and evolution. Science museums might have <u>historical scientific instruments</u>, inventions, and interactive exhibits. Cultural museums preserve items representing specific communities, including traditional crafts, religious objects, and ceremonial items. Some museums focus on specific themes like transport, war, sports, or music. Increasingly, museums also keep <u>digital archives</u> and oral histories. The common thread is that all these items are considered worth preserving because they help us understand our past, appreciate human achievement, or learn about the natural world. Museums serve as <u>collective memory institutions</u> for society."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the influence of technology on museums?",
        answer: "Technology has transformed museums in many positive ways. <u>Digital displays and interactive exhibits</u> make learning more engaging, especially for younger visitors. Instead of just reading plaques, people can watch videos, use touchscreens, and interact with content. Virtual reality and augmented reality are creating <u>immersive experiences</u> where visitors can walk through ancient Rome or see dinosaurs come to life. Technology has also made museums more accessible. Virtual tours allow people anywhere in the world to explore collections online. High-resolution images let people examine artworks in detail they couldn't see in person. Digital archives preserve fragile documents that can't be displayed physically. Behind the scenes, technology helps with <u>conservation and research</u>. Advanced imaging can reveal hidden details in paintings, and climate control systems protect delicate items. There are some concerns though. Some worry that technology distracts from authentic objects, or that virtual experiences might reduce actual visits. I think the key is using technology to <u>enhance rather than replace</u> the real experience of being in a museum surrounded by genuine artifacts."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the benefits of technology for learning history?",
        answer: "Technology has made learning history much more <u>accessible and engaging</u>. First, information is so much easier to find now. Anyone with internet access can explore historical documents, photographs, and resources from archives around the world. Students don't have to rely solely on textbooks. Second, technology brings history to life through <u>documentaries, virtual reconstructions, and interactive simulations</u>. You can virtually walk through ancient cities, see historical events recreated, or explore 3D models of artifacts. This makes history feel real rather than abstract. Third, technology enables <u>diverse perspectives</u> to be heard. Online platforms give voice to histories that were previously overlooked or suppressed. Fourth, educational apps and games can make learning history enjoyable, especially for younger people. They can learn about historical periods while being entertained. Fifth, technology helps connect people with similar interests through <u>online communities and forums</u> where they can discuss and share knowledge. Of course, there are risks like misinformation spreading online, so critical thinking remains essential. But overall, technology has democratized access to history in wonderful ways."

      {
        question: "Why do people visit museums?",
        answer: "People visit museums for various reasons. Education is a big one, whether it's parents wanting to <u>teach their children</u>, students researching for school, or adults simply curious to learn something new. Museums offer knowledge in an accessible, curated way that's different from reading books or browsing the internet. Many people visit for <u>cultural enrichment</u> and to appreciate art, history, or science. There's something special about seeing famous artworks or historical artifacts in person rather than in photos. Tourism is another major factor. Visiting museums is a way to <u>understand a place's culture and history</u> when travelling. Iconic museums become destinations in themselves. Some people seek <u>inspiration and reflection</u>. Artists visit art museums, designers visit design museums, and so on. Museums can spark creativity and new ideas. Others visit for entertainment and <u>family activities</u>. Modern museums with interactive exhibits make for enjoyable outings. There's also social motivation, like meeting friends at exhibitions or attending museum events. And sometimes people visit simply to <u>escape daily routine</u> and spend time in a peaceful, beautiful environment surrounded by fascinating objects."

    answer: `This was about six months ago when my younger sister was trying to decide whether to quit her stable job to pursue her dream of becoming a freelance graphic designer.

She came to me feeling really <u>torn and anxious</u> about the decision. On one hand, she had a secure position at a marketing company with a regular salary and benefits. On the other hand, she'd always been passionate about design and felt unfulfilled doing generic corporate work. She asked what I thought she should do.

My advice to her was not to quit immediately, but to <u>start building her freelance business on the side</u> first. I suggested she take on small projects in her evenings and weekends, build up a portfolio, establish some regular clients, and save enough money to cover at least six months of expenses. Only then should she consider making the leap to full-time freelancing. I also recommended she learn about the <u>business side of freelancing</u>, like invoicing, taxes, and finding clients, while still having the security of her job.

The reason I gave this advice was because I wanted to support her dream while also being <u>realistic about the risks</u>. I've seen people quit stable jobs impulsively and struggle financially, which actually makes pursuing their passion harder because they're stressed about money. I believe in her talent completely, but talent alone doesn't guarantee success as a freelancer. You also need clients, a reputation, and financial stability. By building gradually, she could test whether freelancing really suited her without <u>burning bridges</u>. She actually followed this approach, and after about eight months of side work, she did eventually resign. Now she's freelancing full-time and doing well. She thanked me for the advice because the transition was much <u>smoother and less stressful</u> than it would have been otherwise.`,
    part3Questions: [
      {
        question: "Should people prepare before giving advice?",
        answer: "Yes, I think some preparation or at least careful thought is important before giving advice. The problem with giving advice impulsively is that you might not fully understand the situation or you might <u>project your own experiences</u> onto someone else's different circumstances. Taking time to ask questions, listen properly, and consider the person's specific situation leads to much better advice. It also shows respect for the person asking. However, the level of preparation depends on what kind of advice it is. For casual everyday matters, you don't need extensive research. But for significant decisions about careers, relationships, or finances, it's worth <u>thinking carefully</u> before speaking. You might even want to research or consult others if you're not knowledgeable about the topic. The worst thing is giving confident-sounding advice based on <u>ignorance or assumptions</u>. I think it's also perfectly fine to say you need time to think about it rather than answering immediately. Good advice is thoughtful advice."
      },
      {
        question: "Is it good to ask advice from strangers online?",
        answer: "It can be useful in certain situations, but you need to be <u>cautious and critical</u>. The internet gives you access to people with diverse experiences and expertise that you might not have in your personal network. Online communities focused on specific topics, like health conditions, hobbies, or professions, can provide valuable insights from people who've faced similar situations. Sometimes strangers offer more <u>objective perspectives</u> because they're not emotionally involved. However, there are significant risks. You don't know if the person giving advice is actually knowledgeable or just confident-sounding. People might have hidden agendas or biases. Personal details shared online could be misused. And advice that works for one person might not suit your circumstances at all. I think online advice is best used for <u>gathering different viewpoints</u> and general information, not for making major life decisions. It should complement, not replace, advice from people who actually know you and professionals in relevant fields. Always verify important information from reliable sources."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the personalities of people whose job is to give advice to others?",
        answer: "People who work as advisors, counsellors, or consultants tend to share certain <u>personality traits</u>. First, they're usually good listeners. The best advice comes from understanding the situation thoroughly, and that requires patience and genuine attention to what people are saying. They tend to be <u>empathetic</u>, able to put themselves in others' shoes and understand different perspectives without judgment. Strong communication skills are essential because giving advice effectively means explaining things clearly and appropriately for each person. They often have <u>analytical minds</u> that can break down complex situations and identify options. Trustworthiness and discretion are crucial since people share sensitive information when seeking advice. Good advisors are <u>humble enough</u> to admit the limits of their knowledge and refer people to others when needed. They're usually calm under pressure because people often come to them during stressful times. And they have genuine interest in helping others, though they also maintain professional boundaries. Of course, these are generalizations, and individual personalities vary widely."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the problems if you ask too many people for advice?",
        answer: "Asking too many people creates several problems. The most obvious one is that you'll get <u>conflicting opinions</u>, which can leave you more confused than before. Different people have different experiences, values, and biases, so their advice naturally differs. This can lead to <u>analysis paralysis</u> where you become unable to make any decision because you're trying to reconcile incompatible suggestions. There's also the issue of diluting responsibility. If you're collecting advice from everyone, you might be avoiding taking <u>ownership of your own decision</u>. Another problem is that not all advice is equally valuable. If you ask many people, you're giving equal weight to those who understand your situation and those who don't. This wastes time and can lead you astray. Too much input can also <u>delay action</u>. While you're busy consulting everyone, opportunities might pass. Finally, some people might feel uncomfortable if they later learn you asked many others after asking them. I think it's better to identify a few people whose judgment you trust and focus on quality over quantity."
      },
      {
        question: "Why do some people think it is better to ask for advice from friends than from parents?",
        answer: "There are several reasons why people, especially younger ones, might prefer friends' advice. First, friends are typically from the <u>same generation</u> and face similar challenges, so their advice feels more relevant and relatable. They understand current trends, social dynamics, and pressures in ways parents might not. Second, there's often <u>less judgment</u> from friends. People might fear disappointing their parents or getting lectured, while friends are more likely to accept situations without moralizing. Third, some topics feel <u>too embarrassing or personal</u> to discuss with parents, like relationships, social problems, or certain mistakes. Friends provide a safer space for these conversations. Fourth, parents naturally have a <u>protective instinct</u> that might make their advice overly cautious. Friends might encourage taking risks that parents would advise against. Fifth, the relationship dynamic is different. Advice from friends feels more like a conversation between equals, while parental advice can feel like instruction. Of course, parents often have valuable <u>wisdom and experience</u> that friends lack, so ideally people would seek advice from both sources depending on the situation."
      },
      {
        question: "When would old people ask young people for advice?",
        answer: "Older people typically seek advice from younger people in areas where the young have more <u>current knowledge or experience</u>. Technology is the most obvious example. Young people grew up with smartphones, social media, and the internet, so older people often ask them for help with devices, apps, and online services. Career advice in rapidly changing industries is another area. If an older person is working in tech, digital marketing, or other fast-evolving fields, younger colleagues might have more up-to-date knowledge. Older people might ask young people about <u>current trends and culture</u>, whether it's music, fashion, entertainment, or social attitudes. If they want to understand what's popular or how younger generations think, going to the source makes sense. Grandparents often ask grandchildren for advice when buying gifts for other young people. In some families, roles can shift when adult children become caregivers, and <u>practical advice</u> about healthcare, living arrangements, or daily activities flows from younger to older. I think wise older people recognize that every generation has unique knowledge and are <u>open to learning</u> regardless of the source."

    answer: `Something I've had my eye on for a while now is a high-quality noise-cancelling headphones, specifically the Sony WH-1000XM5.

These headphones cost around $350 to $400 depending on where you buy them. It's definitely not cheap, which is why I haven't bought them yet, but I've been saving up and I think they'd be <u>worth the investment</u>.

I first heard about them from a colleague at work who uses them during his commute. He let me try them once, and I was absolutely <u>blown away</u> by the sound quality and how effectively they blocked out background noise. After that, I started watching reviews on YouTube and reading about them online. Every review seemed to praise them as some of the <u>best headphones on the market</u>.

The main reason I want them is for my daily commute on the train. It's about 45 minutes each way, and the train is always noisy with people talking, announcements, and the sound of the tracks. I currently use cheap earphones, and I can barely hear my music or podcasts over all the noise. With proper noise-cancelling headphones, I could actually <u>enjoy the journey</u> and use that time productively, whether it's listening to audiobooks, studying languages, or just relaxing with music.

They'd also be brilliant for working from home. My apartment isn't exactly quiet, with traffic outside and neighbours who can be noisy. Having the ability to <u>create my own bubble of silence</u> would really help my concentration. And honestly, I'm a bit of a music lover, so having headphones that produce really <u>high-quality sound</u> would make listening to my favourite albums a much better experience. It feels like a purchase that would genuinely improve my daily life.`,

        question: "What are the differences between the technology of the past and that of today?",
        answer: "The differences are really quite dramatic. Past technology was generally <u>larger, slower, and less accessible</u>. Computers used to fill entire rooms, and even personal computers from the 1990s were bulky and had limited capabilities compared to what we carry in our pockets today. Technology in the past was often <u>single-purpose</u>. You had separate devices for making calls, taking photos, playing music, and navigating. Now, a smartphone does all of that and more. Speed has increased exponentially. What took hours or days to process can now happen in seconds. Connectivity is another major difference. In the past, devices worked in isolation, but today everything is connected through the internet. Storage capacity has grown massively while becoming smaller physically. Perhaps most significantly, technology has become <u>democratized</u>. It used to be expensive and only for specialists or wealthy people, but now most people have access to powerful technology. The pace of change has accelerated too. New innovations used to take decades to spread, but now they can go global in months."

        question: "What technology do young people like to use?",
        answer: "Young people today are particularly drawn to <u>social media platforms</u> like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat. These allow them to connect with friends, express themselves, and consume entertainment. Smartphones are absolutely central to their lives, basically an extension of themselves. <u>Gaming technology</u> is hugely popular, whether it's consoles like PlayStation, gaming PCs, or mobile games. Many young people spend hours gaming and watching gaming content. Streaming services for music and video like Spotify and Netflix are essential for entertainment. Wireless earbuds and headphones have become almost universal accessories. Young people also embrace <u>creative technology</u> like video editing apps, digital art tools, and music production software. Smart home devices and voice assistants are popular among tech-savvy youth. Fitness trackers and smartwatches appeal to health-conscious young people. And increasingly, emerging technologies like VR headsets are capturing their interest. Basically, young people tend to adopt new technology faster and more enthusiastically than older generations."

        question: "What are the differences between online and face-to-face communication?",
        answer: "There are several important distinctions. Face-to-face communication is much <u>richer in information</u>. You can see facial expressions, body language, gestures, and subtle cues that reveal how someone really feels. You can sense the atmosphere in a room. Online communication, even video calls, loses much of this richness. Typed messages lose almost all of it, which is why misunderstandings are so common in texts and emails. Face-to-face interactions happen in <u>real-time with no delay</u>, creating natural conversation flow. Online communication often has gaps, whether it's waiting for replies or dealing with connection issues. Physical presence creates a different <u>emotional connection</u>. Sharing a space with someone feels more intimate than a screen. However, online communication offers <u>convenience and reach</u>. You can connect with anyone, anywhere, anytime. It's also easier for some people to express themselves in writing or when not face-to-face. Both have their place, but I think face-to-face remains irreplaceable for important conversations and building deep relationships."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you think technology has changed the way people communicate?",
        answer: "Absolutely, technology has <u>transformed communication completely</u>. The most obvious change is that we can now communicate instantly with anyone in the world. Distance has become almost irrelevant. We can maintain relationships across continents, which was nearly impossible before. The speed of communication has changed expectations too. People expect <u>immediate responses</u>, which creates both convenience and pressure. The modes of communication have multiplied. Beyond traditional calls and texts, we have video calls, voice messages, social media posts, and various messaging apps, each with its own norms and uses. Communication has become more <u>visual</u> with the rise of photos, videos, and emojis. Written communication has changed, becoming more informal and abbreviated. We document and share our lives in ways previous generations never did. However, some argue this has come at a cost. Face-to-face conversations happen less. People sometimes struggle with phone calls or in-person interactions. Attention spans have shortened. So while technology has expanded our communication capabilities enormously, it's also changed its <u>nature and quality</u> in complex ways."
      },
      {
        question: "What negative effects does technology have on people's relationships?",
        answer: "Unfortunately, there are quite a few downsides. One major issue is <u>distraction</u>. How often do you see couples or families at restaurants, all staring at their phones instead of talking to each other? Technology competes for our attention and often wins, even when we're physically with people we care about. Social media can create <u>unrealistic comparisons</u>. People see curated highlights of others' relationships and feel their own aren't good enough. This breeds dissatisfaction and insecurity. Online communication can lead to <u>misunderstandings</u> because we miss tone and context. Arguments over text are often worse than they'd be in person. Technology enables <u>conflict avoidance</u>. Instead of having difficult conversations face-to-face, people hide behind screens or simply ghost others. For romantic relationships, apps have made dating feel more disposable, with always another option a swipe away. <u>Privacy issues</u> can damage trust when partners monitor each other online. And spending excessive time on devices can simply leave less time and energy for nurturing relationships. I think being mindful about technology use in relationships is really important."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the differences between making friends in real life and online?",
        answer: "Making friends in real life typically involves <u>shared physical experiences</u>. You meet through school, work, hobbies, or mutual friends. You spend time together, share activities, and gradually build trust through repeated interactions. There's no filter or curation. You see each other on good days and bad, which creates authentic connection. Physical proximity naturally encourages ongoing contact. Online friendships form differently. You might connect over <u>shared interests</u> regardless of location. You can find people who share very specific hobbies or experiences that might be rare locally. There's more control over <u>self-presentation</u> online, which can be both positive and deceptive. Online friendships often develop through consistent messaging over time. The downside is that online friendships can feel less real or stable. It's easier to drift apart when there's no physical presence. Some people present false versions of themselves online. And nothing quite replaces <u>being physically together</u>, sharing experiences in real-time. That said, many genuine friendships form online and some eventually transition to real life. I think both types of friendships can be meaningful, but they develop and feel differently."

      "Who he/she is",
      "How you knew him/her",
      "What plans he/she makes",
      "And explain how you feel about this person"
    ],
    answer: `The person who immediately comes to mind is my aunt, Jennifer. She's probably the most <u>organized person</u> I've ever met.

I've known her my whole life obviously, since she's my mother's sister. We see each other regularly at family gatherings, and I've spent holidays at her house many times growing up. She's also been something of a <u>mentor</u> to me, especially when it comes to career and life advice.

When it comes to planning, she's incredibly thorough. She plans everything from <u>daily schedules</u> to long-term life goals. For example, she has detailed weekly meal plans complete with shopping lists. She plans family holidays months in advance, with spreadsheets covering activities, budgets, and backup options. At work, she's a project manager, so planning is literally her job. She creates timelines, anticipates potential problems, and always seems to be three steps ahead. Even for casual family dinners, she'll have thought about everything from seating arrangements to conversation topics.

What's impressive is that her plans aren't rigid. She builds in <u>flexibility</u> and contingencies. If something doesn't work out, she has plan B ready. She's taught me that good planning isn't about controlling everything but about being prepared for different outcomes.

Honestly, I really admire her for this ability. It used to seem a bit excessive to me when I was younger, but now I see how much <u>stress and chaos</u> her planning prevents. Her life runs smoothly, and she rarely seems overwhelmed even when juggling many responsibilities. She's also generous with her skills, helping family members plan weddings, moves, and other big events. I've tried to learn from her and become more organized myself, though I don't think I'll ever match her level. She's shown me that being good at planning is really a <u>valuable life skill</u> that makes everything easier.`,
    part3Questions: [
      {
        question: "Do you think it's important to plan ahead?",
        answer: "Yes, I think planning ahead is quite important for most aspects of life. Having a plan gives you <u>direction and focus</u>. Without it, you might drift aimlessly or waste time and resources on things that don't matter. Planning helps you anticipate problems and prepare solutions before they become crises. It reduces stress because you're not constantly scrambling to figure out what to do next. For big goals like education, career, or finances, <u>long-term planning</u> is essential. You can't save enough for retirement or build skills for your dream job without some forward thinking. That said, I don't think you need to plan every tiny detail. Over-planning can make you inflexible and anxious when things don't go exactly as expected. Life is unpredictable, so plans need to be adaptable. I think the balance is having <u>clear goals and general strategies</u> while staying open to adjusting along the way. Some spontaneity and flexibility are healthy too. So planning is important, but so is knowing when to deviate from the plan."
      },
      {
        question: "What activities do we need to plan ahead?",
        answer: "Certain activities definitely benefit from advance planning. <u>Travel</u> is an obvious one. Booking flights, accommodation, and attractions in advance often saves money and ensures availability. Big events like weddings, conferences, or parties require extensive planning because so many elements need to coordinate. <u>Financial decisions</u> like saving for a house, retirement, or education need long-term planning. Career development benefits from planning, thinking about what skills to develop and what opportunities to pursue. Home renovations or moves require careful planning to minimize disruption. Academic pursuits, whether it's studying for exams or completing a degree, need structured plans. Health-related changes like starting a fitness program or addressing medical issues often require planning. Even <u>daily life</u> runs smoother with some planning, like meal preparation for the week or scheduling appointments. Basically, anything that involves multiple steps, significant resources, coordination with others, or important deadlines benefits from planning. Spontaneous activities like grabbing coffee with a friend don't need much planning, but most substantial endeavors do."

        question: "Do you think children should plan their future careers?",
        answer: "I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, I don't think very young children should feel pressure to decide their entire career path. They need freedom to <u>explore different interests</u> and discover what they enjoy and what they're good at. Forcing career decisions too early can create stress and might lead them down paths that aren't right for them. People change, and the careers available when a child grows up might be very different from today's options. That said, as children get older, especially in teenage years, some <u>thoughtful exploration</u> of future possibilities is valuable. Understanding different career options, developing relevant skills, and thinking about what kind of life they want can help guide educational choices. I think it's more about developing <u>general direction and adaptable skills</u> rather than rigid career plans. Parents and schools should expose children to various possibilities and help them develop self-awareness about their strengths and interests. The specific career might change many times, but good foundational thinking about the future is helpful."
      },
      {
        question: "Should children ask their teachers and parents for advice when making plans?",
        answer: "Yes, I think seeking guidance from adults is valuable when children are making plans, whether about school, activities, or the future. Teachers and parents have <u>experience and perspective</u> that children lack. They've seen what works and what doesn't. They understand consequences that children might not anticipate. They know the child's strengths and weaknesses and can offer personalized advice. Teachers specifically have expertise in educational paths and can suggest appropriate challenges. Parents understand their child's personality and family circumstances. However, the way advice is given matters. It shouldn't be <u>dictating decisions</u> but rather helping children think through options and consider different angles. Children should also be encouraged to develop their own judgment over time. The goal is to guide them toward making good decisions themselves, not to make decisions for them forever. As children grow older, they should take increasing ownership of their plans while still valuing adult input. So yes, definitely ask for advice, but also learn to <u>evaluate that advice critically</u> and ultimately make your own choices."

        question: "Is making study plans popular among young people?",
        answer: "I'd say it varies a lot depending on the individual and their circumstances. Among <u>academically ambitious students</u>, especially those preparing for important exams or applications, study planning is quite common and taken seriously. They create revision schedules, set targets, and track their progress. In competitive educational environments, study planning becomes almost essential to keep up. However, many young people don't naturally gravitate toward planning. They might prefer to <u>study spontaneously</u> or just before deadlines. Some find rigid plans restrictive or stressful. The popularity of study planning has probably increased with awareness of productivity techniques and apps that make planning easier and even gamified. Social media has spread study planning trends like bullet journals and aesthetic timetables. But there's often a gap between <u>making plans and following them</u>. Many young people create beautiful study schedules that they quickly abandon. I think the key is finding a planning approach that matches your personality. Some thrive with detailed schedules while others work better with flexible guidelines. What matters is that the plan actually helps rather than becoming another source of stress."

        question: "Do you think choosing a college major is closely related to a person's future career?",
        answer: "It's related, but I don't think it's as deterministic as people often assume. Some majors do lead <u>directly to specific careers</u>. If you study medicine, you become a doctor. Engineering leads to engineering jobs. These professional degrees have clear career paths. But for many other majors, the connection is much looser. Someone with a history degree might become a teacher, journalist, lawyer, business consultant, or countless other things. Many successful people work in fields unrelated to their major. Employers often care more about <u>skills and experience</u> than the specific degree title. A liberal arts education develops critical thinking, communication, and adaptability that apply broadly. That said, your major does matter in practical ways. It affects your first job opportunities and can make certain paths easier or harder. Some careers require specific qualifications. The knowledge and networks you gain in your major shape your early options. I think students should consider career implications when choosing majors but not feel their entire future is determined by this one decision. <u>Continuous learning and career changes</u> are normal now. Your major is a starting point, not a destiny."

      "How/when you knew him/her",
      "How often he/she draws/paints",
      "And explain why you think he/she loves drawing/painting"
    ],
    answer: `The child I want to describe is my niece, Emma. She's eight years old and absolutely <u>obsessed with drawing</u>.

I've known Emma since she was born, obviously, as she's my brother's daughter. I see her regularly at family gatherings and sometimes babysit her on weekends. I've watched her love for art develop over the years, but it really <u>blossomed</u> when she was around five or six.

Emma draws almost every single day without fail. She carries a small sketchbook everywhere she goes. Whether she's at home, visiting relatives, or waiting at a restaurant, she'll be drawing. Her bedroom walls are covered with her artwork, and she has boxes full of drawings she's made over the years. She draws during breakfast, after school, and especially on weekends when she can spend <u>hours at a time</u> completely absorbed in her art. My brother jokes that they've spent a fortune on art supplies because she goes through paper and coloured pencils so quickly.

I think she loves drawing for several reasons. First, she's naturally talented. Even at her young age, her drawings show real <u>creativity and attention to detail</u>. Getting positive feedback from family, teachers, and friends encourages her to keep going. Second, drawing seems to be her way of <u>expressing herself</u>. She draws things she cares about, whether that's her pet hamster, characters from her favourite stories, or scenes from her imagination. Third, I think it gives her a sense of calm and focus. When she's drawing, she enters this peaceful state where nothing else matters. It's almost like <u>meditation</u> for her. Finally, she genuinely finds it fun. She doesn't see it as work or practice. For her, creating pictures is pure joy. I really hope she continues nurturing this passion as she grows up.`,
    part3Questions: [
      {
        question: "What is the right age for a child to learn drawing?",
        answer: "Honestly, I don't think there's a single right age because children can start engaging with drawing as soon as they can hold a crayon, which is usually around <u>one or two years old</u>. At that stage, it's just scribbling, but it's the beginning of their creative expression. Around three to four, children start making more intentional marks and recognizable shapes. By five or six, many can draw people, houses, and other objects. But I think the question might also be about formal art instruction, and for that, opinions vary. Some believe structured lessons should wait until children have developed better <u>motor skills and attention spans</u>, perhaps around seven or eight. Others think earlier exposure to techniques can be beneficial if it's playful and not pressured. What matters most is that the experience is <u>enjoyable and encouraging</u> at any age. Forcing children into rigid instruction too early might actually discourage creativity. Every child develops at their own pace, so rather than a specific right age, I'd say the right time is when the child shows interest and when the teaching approach matches their developmental stage."
      },
      {
        question: "Why do most children draw more often than adults do?",
        answer: "There are several reasons for this difference. First, children have more <u>free time</u> and fewer responsibilities. Adults are busy with work, household tasks, and various obligations that leave little time for creative activities. Second, children haven't developed the <u>self-criticism and fear of judgment</u> that stops many adults. Adults worry about whether their drawings are good enough, while children just enjoy the process without caring about the result. Third, drawing is actively encouraged in childhood through school art classes and parents providing art supplies. Adults don't receive the same encouragement and might feel drawing is childish or unproductive. Fourth, as people grow up, they often <u>specialize</u> in activities they're naturally good at and drop others. If someone wasn't particularly talented at drawing, they probably stopped doing it as they got older. Fifth, digital entertainment and other adult hobbies compete for the leisure time adults do have. Drawing requires more <u>patience and presence</u> than scrolling through a phone. It's actually quite sad because adults could benefit greatly from the relaxation and creativity that drawing provides."

      {
        question: "Why do some people visit galleries or museums instead of viewing artworks online?",
        answer: "There's something irreplaceable about <u>seeing art in person</u>. First, you experience the true scale of artworks. A painting that looks small on a screen might be massive in real life, completely changing its impact. The brushstrokes, textures, and colours are visible in ways that <u>digital reproduction can't capture</u>. You might notice details invisible in photographs. Second, there's the atmosphere of being in a gallery. The quiet, contemplative environment encourages deep engagement with art. It's a dedicated space away from daily distractions. Third, visiting galleries is often a <u>social or cultural experience</u>. People go with friends, attend exhibitions as events, or combine gallery visits with exploring a new city. It's about more than just the art. Fourth, standing in front of an original work knowing it was created by a famous artist, perhaps centuries ago, creates a <u>sense of connection and awe</u> that viewing a copy can't match. Fifth, galleries provide context through curation, explanatory texts, and related works displayed together. While online viewing is convenient and accessible, it simply can't replicate the full experience."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you think galleries and museums should be free of charge?",
        answer: "This is something I've thought about quite a bit. On one hand, making galleries and museums free would <u>democratize access to culture</u>. Everyone, regardless of income, could enjoy art and learn about history. This seems fair since many museums receive public funding and hold collections that arguably belong to everyone. Free entry increases visitor numbers and can especially benefit families and students who might otherwise not visit. However, there are practical considerations. Running museums is expensive, with costs for staff, maintenance, conservation, and new acquisitions. <u>Entry fees help fund</u> these essential activities. Without them, museums might struggle financially or become more dependent on government funding, which can be unreliable. A compromise I like is having <u>free entry on certain days</u> or times, reduced prices for specific groups like students and seniors, and free access to permanent collections while charging for special exhibitions. Some famous museums like the British Museum already operate this way. The key is ensuring that cost never completely prevents someone from experiencing art and culture."

      {
        question: "How do artworks inspire people?",
        answer: "Art inspires people in many profound ways. First, it can <u>evoke powerful emotions</u> that we might struggle to access otherwise. A painting, sculpture, or performance can make us feel joy, sadness, wonder, or contemplation. These emotional experiences enrich our inner lives. Second, art offers <u>new perspectives and ideas</u>. Artists see the world differently and their work challenges us to look beyond our usual viewpoints. This can change how we think about society, nature, relationships, or ourselves. Third, art inspires creativity in others. Seeing what artists have created motivates people to <u>try their own creative projects</u>, whether in art or other fields. Fourth, art can provide comfort and hope. Beautiful or meaningful works remind us of what's good in humanity and the world, especially during difficult times. Fifth, art inspires <u>conversation and connection</u>. People discuss artworks, share reactions, and bond over shared aesthetic experiences. Finally, art can inspire action. Works addressing social issues have motivated movements for change throughout history. Art's power to inspire is really limitless."

      {
        question: "What are the differences between reading a book and visiting a museum?",
        answer: "Both are valuable cultural experiences, but they differ in important ways. Reading is primarily a <u>solitary, internal experience</u>. You engage with words and your imagination creates the pictures. It requires extended time and concentration. You can read anywhere and at your own pace, stopping and starting as you wish. Books offer depth, allowing authors to develop complex ideas, characters, and narratives over hundreds of pages. Museum visits are more <u>sensory and immediate</u>. You see physical objects, experience spaces, and might hear sounds or interact with exhibits. It's often a social activity shared with others. The experience is more structured by the museum's layout and exhibition design. Information tends to be presented in shorter, more accessible chunks. Museums offer <u>authenticity</u> that books can't match. Seeing a real dinosaur fossil or an original painting is different from reading about them. However, books provide <u>context and analysis</u> that brief museum labels can't. They can take you places museums can't recreate. Ideally, reading about a subject before or after visiting a museum creates the richest understanding. They complement each other rather than compete."

    answer: `An app I use constantly is Notion. It's basically an <u>all-in-one workspace</u> for notes, tasks, databases, and project management.

I use this app every single day, probably checking it at least ten to fifteen times daily. It's become <u>central to how I organize my life</u>.

I use it in the morning to check my tasks for the day and plan what I need to accomplish. During work, I use it to take meeting notes, track projects, and store reference information. In the evenings, I sometimes use it for personal things like planning trips, keeping reading lists, or tracking habits. Basically, anything I need to remember or organize goes into Notion. The app works on my phone, laptop, and tablet, and everything <u>syncs automatically</u>, which means I can access my information wherever I am.

I discovered it about two years ago when I was struggling with having notes scattered across different apps, sticky notes everywhere, and constant forgetting of tasks. A colleague mentioned she used Notion to stay organized, so I decided to give it a try. It took some time to learn because it's quite <u>powerful and flexible</u>, but once I understood the basics, I was hooked.

I absolutely love this app. It's genuinely <u>transformed my productivity</u>. Before Notion, I felt constantly disorganized and overwhelmed. Important things would slip through the cracks. Now, everything has a place. My mind feels clearer because I'm not trying to remember everything. The flexibility is amazing because you can customize it to work exactly how you think. I've recommended it to so many friends and family members. If I had to delete all apps except one, Notion would probably be the one I'd keep.`,

        question: "What are the differences between old and young people when using apps?",
        answer: "There are several notable differences in how different generations use apps. Young people generally pick up new apps much <u>faster and more intuitively</u>. They've grown up with touchscreens and apps, so the concepts are natural to them. They're more willing to experiment and explore features without fear of breaking something. Older people might be more cautious and prefer clear instructions. Young people tend to use a <u>wider variety of apps</u>, especially social media and entertainment apps, and switch between them quickly. Older generations often stick to fewer, practical apps like messaging, maps, and utilities. Young people are more likely to adopt the latest trending apps, while older users might be satisfied with established ones that work well. However, when older people do adopt apps, they often use them very <u>purposefully and consistently</u>. Younger people might download many apps and barely use most of them. There's also a difference in privacy awareness. Younger people sometimes share more freely on apps, while older generations may be more concerned about data privacy. Of course, these are generalizations, and individual variations are huge."
      },
      {
        question: "Why do some people not like using apps?",
        answer: "There are various reasons people resist using apps. Some simply find technology <u>confusing or intimidating</u>. They didn't grow up with smartphones and learning feels difficult, especially when apps change frequently. Others have <u>privacy concerns</u> about sharing personal data with apps that might track them or sell their information. These worries are often legitimate. Some people dislike how apps can be <u>addictive and time-consuming</u>. They've seen themselves or others endlessly scrolling and prefer to avoid that temptation. Others feel that apps create <u>unnecessary dependency</u>. They managed fine before smartphones and question whether apps really improve their lives. There's also frustration with apps constantly requiring updates, taking up phone storage, or sending annoying notifications. Some people simply prefer <u>traditional methods</u> like paper calendars, physical books, or face-to-face interactions. They find these more satisfying or reliable. And honestly, some apps are genuinely poorly designed, frustrating to use, or don't solve real problems. Not liking specific bad apps is perfectly reasonable. I think the key is choosing which apps genuinely add value rather than feeling obligated to use everything available."
      },
      {
        question: "What apps are popular in your country? Why?",
        answer: "Several types of apps are extremely popular here. <u>Messaging apps</u> like WhatsApp are practically universal for personal communication. Everyone uses them because they're free and all their contacts are there. Social media apps like Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook have huge user bases, especially among younger people, because they satisfy the need for <u>connection and entertainment</u>. Payment and banking apps have grown massively as people prefer convenient <u>cashless transactions</u>. Food delivery apps are very popular, especially in cities, because they offer convenience and variety. Ride-sharing apps have transformed urban transportation. <u>E-commerce apps</u> from major retailers see heavy use for shopping convenience. Music streaming apps like Spotify have largely replaced downloaded music. Maps and navigation apps are essential for getting around. Gaming apps have massive audiences across all age groups. Health and fitness apps have grown, especially after increased health awareness. The common theme is that popular apps solve <u>real everyday problems</u> or provide entertainment in convenient ways. Apps that catch on usually benefit from network effects where having more users makes them more valuable."

        question: "Should parents limit their children's use of computer programs and computer games? Why and how?",
        answer: "Yes, I believe some level of parental oversight is necessary, though the approach matters a lot. Unlimited screen time can lead to problems like <u>reduced physical activity</u>, poor sleep, shortened attention spans, and less face-to-face social interaction. Children might be exposed to inappropriate content or develop unhealthy relationships with technology. However, strict bans often backfire, making forbidden apps more appealing and preventing children from developing <u>healthy digital habits</u>. I think a balanced approach works best. Setting reasonable <u>time limits</u> appropriate to the child's age is important, perhaps one to two hours daily for younger children, with flexibility for older ones. Parents should know what apps and games their children use and occasionally play or use them together to understand what's involved. Having <u>screen-free times</u>, like during meals and before bed, creates boundaries. Teaching children to self-regulate is the ultimate goal. Explaining why limits exist and gradually giving more freedom as children demonstrate responsibility prepares them for adult life. It's about guiding rather than just restricting."

        question: "Do you think young people are more and more reliant on these programs?",
        answer: "Yes, I think there's definitely a growing reliance on apps and programs among young people. For many, their phones are the <u>first thing they check</u> in the morning and the last thing at night. Apps handle so much of daily life now. Communication happens through messaging apps rather than calls or in-person chat. Entertainment comes from streaming apps and games. Navigation relies on maps apps. Shopping, banking, and even dating happen through apps. This level of integration means young people often feel <u>lost without their phones</u>. The skills to function without apps, like reading paper maps, remembering phone numbers, or occupying oneself without digital entertainment, are less developed. There are real concerns about what happens if systems fail or batteries die. However, I'd nuance this by saying the reliance isn't necessarily negative. Apps genuinely make many things easier and more efficient. The issue is when reliance becomes <u>unhealthy dependency</u> that creates anxiety or inability to function without technology. Teaching young people to use apps as helpful tools while maintaining basic life skills and the ability to disconnect seems important."

        question: "What do you think about some countries banning children from using social media?",
        answer: "This is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides. I understand the concerns driving these bans. Social media has been linked to <u>mental health issues</u> in young people, including anxiety, depression, and body image problems. Children can be exposed to cyberbullying, inappropriate content, and predatory behavior. Their developing brains might be particularly vulnerable to the addictive design of these platforms. Their data and privacy deserve protection. However, I have reservations about complete bans. They're difficult to <u>enforce effectively</u> and might push children toward less regulated platforms. Social media also has benefits for young people, like maintaining friendships, exploring interests, and learning digital literacy. Outright bans don't teach children how to use these tools responsibly, which they'll need as adults. I think <u>regulation and design requirements</u> might be more effective than bans. Making platforms safer by default, limiting features that exploit psychological vulnerabilities, requiring age verification, and empowering parents with better controls could help. Education about healthy social media use is also crucial. A combination of protective measures and preparation seems wiser than prohibition alone."

    answer: `One occasion that really stands out was my cousin's wedding last summer. It was honestly one of those days where I don't think I saw a single person without a smile on their face.

The wedding was held at this beautiful outdoor venue in the countryside. I was there with my whole extended family, about fifty of us plus maybe another hundred guests from the groom's side and their friends.

The ceremony itself was <u>incredibly moving</u>. My cousin and her husband wrote their own vows, and they managed to be both funny and touching at the same time. I remember looking around during the ceremony and everyone had these <u>warm, genuine smiles</u>, some people even had tears streaming down their faces while smiling.

After the ceremony, there was a reception with dancing, speeches, and amazing food. The father of the bride gave this hilarious speech about my cousin's childhood that had everyone <u>laughing so hard</u> their faces hurt. Then the couple did their first dance, and it was so sweet watching them.

I think people were smiling for so many reasons that day. Obviously weddings are happy occasions celebrating love, and everyone there genuinely cared about the couple. The atmosphere was just <u>infectious</u>. When you're surrounded by happy people, you can't help but feel happy too. The weather was perfect, the food was delicious, and there was this sense of family and community coming together. It reminded me how powerful it is when people gather for a <u>joyful purpose</u>. Those kinds of days restore your faith in happiness.`,

        question: "Do you think people who like to smile are more friendly?",
        answer: "Generally speaking, yes, I do think smiling makes people appear more friendly and <u>approachable</u>. When someone smiles at you, it sends a signal that they're open to interaction and not threatening. It creates an <u>immediate sense of warmth</u> and puts others at ease. However, I'd be careful not to assume too much from smiles alone. Some genuinely kind people are naturally more reserved and don't smile as much, while some people smile a lot as a social mask even when they don't feel particularly friendly. Cultural factors matter too because in some cultures, smiling at strangers is normal, while in others it might seem unusual. I also think there's a difference between genuine smiles that reach the eyes and polite or forced smiles. Real smiles that show actual happiness or warmth are much more <u>convincing signals</u> of friendliness. So while smiling is generally associated with friendliness, it's just one piece of the puzzle. Actions and consistency over time tell you more about whether someone is truly friendly."

      {
        question: "Why do most people smile in photographs?",
        answer: "There are several reasons for this. The most obvious is <u>social convention</u>. We've been taught from childhood to say cheese and smile for the camera. It's become automatic behavior. People associate photographs with capturing happy memories, so smiling seems appropriate even if you're not particularly happy at that moment. There's also an element of <u>self-presentation</u>. We want to look good in photos, and most people believe they look more attractive when smiling. Smiling makes faces appear friendlier and more pleasant. Since photos are often shared with others or kept for years, people want to present their best selves. Additionally, the act of taking a photo often happens during positive occasions like celebrations, holidays, or gatherings with loved ones, when people genuinely do feel happy. Photographers and others present often <u>actively encourage smiling</u> too. Interestingly, this wasn't always the case. In very early photography, people rarely smiled due to long exposure times and cultural norms of the time. The smiling photo is really a relatively modern phenomenon that has become deeply ingrained in our habits."

        question: "Do women smile more than men? Why?",
        answer: "Research does suggest that on average, women tend to smile more frequently than men in many contexts. There are several possible explanations for this pattern. From a <u>social conditioning</u> perspective, girls are often raised to be more emotionally expressive and accommodating. Society has traditionally expected women to be warm, nurturing, and pleasant, which includes smiling. Boys, meanwhile, might be taught to suppress emotional displays and appear more stoic. There may also be <u>power dynamics</u> at play. Historically, women have often held less social power, and smiling can be a way of appearing non-threatening and building rapport with those who have more power. In professional settings, women sometimes report feeling pressure to smile to be perceived as friendly rather than aggressive. However, I think these patterns are changing as gender expectations evolve. It's also important to note these are averages with huge <u>individual variation</u>. Many men smile frequently, and many women don't. Personality, culture, and context matter much more than gender alone."
      },
      {
        question: "Do people smile more when they are younger or older?",
        answer: "From my observation, <u>young children</u> probably smile the most naturally and frequently. They haven't yet learned to mask their emotions, so when they're happy, they show it immediately and openly. Teenagers often go through a phase of smiling less, perhaps because of <u>self-consciousness</u> and the desire to appear cool or mature. Young adults and adults in their prime often smile contextually, more in social situations but less when focused on work or stressed by responsibilities. As for older people, it really varies. Some elderly people become more serious or withdrawn, especially if facing health issues or loss. But others seem to reach a stage of life where they worry less about what others think and smile more freely again. They've often developed a sense of <u>perspective and acceptance</u> that comes with experience. Research on happiness actually suggests there's a U-shaped curve where people are happiest in youth, dip in middle age, and often become happier again in later years. So smiling likely follows a similar pattern for many, though individual circumstances vary enormously."
      },
      {
        question: "Is smiling important in your culture?",
        answer: "Yes, smiling is generally considered important in my culture, though there are nuances. We value smiling as a sign of <u>politeness, friendliness, and approachability</u>. In customer service, hospitality, and social interactions, smiling is expected and appreciated. Children are often taught to smile when greeting adults or taking photos. A smile can ease tensions and make social interactions smoother. However, we also recognize that constant or excessive smiling can seem <u>insincere or even inappropriate</u> in certain contexts. At funerals, during serious discussions, or when delivering bad news, smiling would be considered disrespectful. There's also an understanding that genuine smiles matter more than forced ones. People can usually tell the difference, and fake smiles can actually create distrust. Compared to some other cultures, I'd say we're somewhere in the middle. We're not as reserved as some cultures where smiling at strangers might seem odd, but we're also not as <u>enthusiastically smiley</u> as some others. Context really determines when and how much smiling is appropriate."
      },
      {
        question: "Are there any occasions when people need to pretend to smile?",
        answer: "Yes, unfortunately pretend smiling is quite common in many situations. <u>Professional contexts</u> often require it. Customer service workers, flight attendants, and salespeople are expected to smile even when dealing with difficult customers or feeling tired. This is sometimes called emotional labor. Social situations frequently involve polite smiling that isn't entirely genuine. Meeting acquaintances you don't particularly like, receiving gifts you don't want, or listening to boring stories often requires fake smiles to maintain harmony. At some events like parties or networking functions, people smile to appear friendly and engaged even when they'd rather be elsewhere. <u>Photographs</u> often capture forced smiles, as we discussed earlier. Family gatherings can sometimes involve pretend happiness when there are underlying tensions. Even in dating, people might smile to seem more attractive or interested than they genuinely are. While some degree of social smiling is necessary for <u>smooth social functioning</u>, excessive pretense can be exhausting and even harmful to mental health. I think it's healthy to have spaces and relationships where you can be authentic without forcing smiles."

    answer: `The thing I honestly couldn't imagine living without is my coffee maker. Specifically, it's a nice espresso machine that I bought about three years ago.

Every single morning without fail, the first thing I do after waking up is make myself a coffee. It's become such a <u>deeply ingrained ritual</u> that mornings wouldn't feel right without it. I grind fresh beans, tamp the coffee, and watch the espresso pour into my cup. On weekends I'll make a proper latte with steamed milk.

This little machine helps me in so many ways. Obviously, the caffeine <u>wakes me up</u> and helps me function, especially on those tough Monday mornings. But it's more than just the caffeine. The whole process of making coffee has become a kind of <u>meditation</u> for me. Those ten minutes in the morning while I prepare my coffee are peaceful moments before the day gets busy.

Having good coffee at home also saves me a fortune. I used to spend money at coffee shops every day, which adds up quickly. Now I make <u>better coffee for a fraction of the cost</u>.

Honestly, I get a bit anxious if I run out of coffee beans or if the machine has problems. When it broke once, I felt completely lost and had to go out for coffee three days in a row until it was fixed. My friends tease me about being dependent on it, but I think having something that brings you joy every day isn't a bad thing. It's such a simple pleasure that <u>significantly improves my quality of life</u>.`,
    part3Questions: [
      {
        question: "Why are children attracted to new things (such as electronics)?",
        answer: "Children are naturally drawn to new things for several reasons. First, they have an innate sense of <u>curiosity and wonder</u>. Everything is new to them, and exploration is how they learn about the world. New objects, especially electronics with lights, sounds, and interactive elements, are incredibly stimulating to their developing brains. Electronics in particular offer <u>immediate feedback and rewards</u>, which children find very satisfying. Press a button, something happens. This cause-and-effect relationship is fascinating to them. Many devices are also designed to be visually appealing and engaging, with bright colours and animations. Children are also influenced by what they see around them. If adults and older children use certain devices, younger ones naturally want to imitate and <u>feel included</u>. Peer influence matters too because if friends have something, children often want it as well. Additionally, new electronics often provide entertainment and games, which appeal to children's love of play. Their attention spans are shorter, so the constant novelty that electronics provide keeps them engaged in ways that less dynamic toys might not."

      {
        question: "Why do some grown-ups hate to throw out old things (such as clothes)?",
        answer: "There are many psychological reasons behind this tendency. <u>Sentimental attachment</u> is a big one. Clothes and objects often carry memories of specific times, places, or people. Throwing them away can feel like throwing away those memories. Some people also keep things because of the potential for future use. That dress you haven't worn in years might be perfect for an event someday, or at least that's what you tell yourself. There's also the <u>financial consideration</u>. If you spent good money on something, it feels wasteful to discard it even if you no longer use it. Older generations who experienced scarcity often have deeply ingrained habits of keeping things just in case. There can be <u>anxiety about regret</u> too. What if you throw something away and then need it? For some, accumulated possessions provide a sense of security and identity. Their things represent their history and who they are. And honestly, going through old belongings and making decisions about each item requires time and emotional energy that busy adults often don't have. It's easier to just keep everything."
      },
      {
        question: "Is the way people buy things affected? How?",
        answer: "Absolutely, buying habits have been <u>dramatically transformed</u> in recent years. The rise of online shopping is the most obvious change. People can now buy almost anything from home at any hour, which has increased both convenience and impulse purchasing. Social media has created new influences on buying. <u>Targeted advertising</u> shows us products based on our browsing and interests. Influencers promote products constantly. This exposure creates desires we might not have had otherwise. Reviews and ratings from other customers now heavily impact decisions. People research before buying in ways they never did before. Payment methods have evolved too. Credit cards, buy-now-pay-later services, and digital wallets make spending easier and less tangible than handing over cash. This can lead to <u>overspending</u>. Subscription models have changed how we access things from entertainment to clothing to food. People increasingly rent or subscribe rather than own outright. Environmental awareness has also affected some consumers who now consider sustainability. However, fast fashion and cheap goods still dominate for many. Overall, buying has become more convenient but also more manipulated by technology and marketing."
      },
      {
        question: "What do you think influences people to buy new things?",
        answer: "Many factors influence purchasing decisions. <u>Marketing and advertising</u> are hugely powerful. Companies spend billions because it works. They create desire, associate products with lifestyles, and make us feel we need things we'd never considered. Social influence is massive. When friends, family, or people we admire have something, we often want it too. Social media has <u>amplified this effect</u> enormously, with constant exposure to what others have. Practical need does drive some purchases. Things wear out or circumstances change, requiring new items. However, true need is probably a smaller factor than we'd like to admit. Emotional states influence buying significantly. People shop when bored, stressed, or seeking happiness. <u>Retail therapy</u> is real for many. The desire for novelty and stimulation is deeply human. New things are exciting, even if briefly. Discounts and sales create urgency and the feeling of getting a good deal, prompting purchases that might not happen otherwise. Convenience matters too. The easier it is to buy something, the more likely we are to do it. One-click purchasing removes friction and deliberation. Status and identity also play roles. We buy things that signal who we are or who we want to be."

      {
        question: "Why do all children like toys?",
        answer: "Toys appeal to children for fundamental developmental and psychological reasons. First, <u>play is how children learn</u>. It's not optional entertainment but essential to cognitive, physical, and social development. Toys facilitate this natural learning process. Children have incredible imaginations, and toys become tools for <u>creative expression and storytelling</u>. A simple doll or action figure can become anything in a child's narrative world. Toys provide sensory stimulation that young brains crave. Colours, textures, sounds, and movements engage their developing senses. Physical toys help develop <u>motor skills</u>, from building blocks improving fine motor control to balls developing coordination. Many toys involve problem-solving, whether it's puzzles, construction sets, or figuring out how something works, which exercises their minds. Toys also provide emotional comfort and companionship. Children form attachments to favourite toys that help them feel secure. Social play with toys teaches sharing, cooperation, and conflict resolution. Finally, toys are simply <u>fun</u>. They bring joy and happiness, and children naturally gravitate toward what makes them feel good. The universal appeal of toys reflects universal aspects of childhood development."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you think it is good for a child to always take his or her favourite toy with them all the time?",
        answer: "This is an interesting question with nuances. Having a favourite comfort object, often called a <u>transitional object</u>, is very normal and can be healthy for young children. These items provide security and help children cope with separations, new situations, and stress. They're especially important during developmental stages when children are learning independence from parents. So in many ways, yes, it's fine and even beneficial. However, there can be some concerns if taken to extremes. If a child becomes so attached that they <u>can't function</u> without the toy, panic if it's lost, or refuse to engage with situations when they can't have it, that might need gentle addressing. The toy shouldn't become a barrier to normal development or social interaction. <u>Practical issues</u> arise too. Favourite toys can get lost, damaged, or become hygiene concerns if never washed. Parents might want to limit where certain toys go. As children grow older, constant attachment might invite teasing from peers. I think the key is balance and gradual transition. Allow comfort objects when genuinely needed, but gently encourage coping without them too. Most children naturally reduce attachment as they develop other <u>coping mechanisms</u> and social bonds."

    answer: `This happened last year when I attended a meditation retreat for a weekend. No phones were allowed for the entire three days, and we actually had to hand them in at the start.

The retreat was held at a peaceful centre in the mountains, about two hours from the city. I went with a friend who had been before and convinced me it would be <u>good for my mental health</u>.

The reason for the phone ban was obvious when you think about it. The whole point of the retreat was to disconnect from daily life and be fully present. Phones would completely <u>defeat the purpose</u>. The organizers explained that even having a phone nearby, even if switched off, creates a mental pull. They wanted us to experience what it's like to be truly unreachable and undistracted.

Honestly, my feelings about it changed throughout the weekend. At first I felt <u>genuinely anxious</u>. I kept reaching for my pocket out of habit. I worried about missing something important from work or family. The first evening felt strangely empty without my usual scrolling before bed.

But by the second day, something shifted. I started noticing things more. The sounds of birds, the quality of light, other people's faces. My mind felt <u>quieter and clearer</u>. By the third day, I actually dreaded getting my phone back.

When we did get them back at the end, seeing all those notifications felt overwhelming rather than exciting. That weekend really showed me how much my phone <u>fragments my attention</u> and creates background stress. I now try to have phone-free periods regularly, though I haven't quite replicated that peaceful feeling.`,
    part3Questions: [

        question: "How do young and old people use mobile phones differently?",
        answer: "There are quite noticeable differences in usage patterns. Young people tend to use phones for a <u>much wider range of activities</u>. Social media, gaming, watching videos, messaging with multiple apps, taking photos and videos, streaming music, online shopping, and more. Their phones are entertainment hubs and social lifelines. They're comfortable navigating complex apps and discovering new ones. Older people often use phones more <u>functionally and simply</u>. Calls, texts, perhaps WhatsApp for family groups, basic photography, and practical apps like maps or banking. They may have fewer apps and use them less intensively. Young people are often constantly connected and checking phones frequently, while older users might check periodically for specific purposes. Young people tend to text rather than call, while older generations often still prefer voice conversations. However, these generalizations are shifting as today's middle-aged adults grew up with technology too. There's also huge <u>individual variation</u>. I know teenagers who barely use social media and grandparents who are very tech-savvy. But on average, young people are more immersed in their phones and use them more constantly."

      {
        question: "What positive and negative impact do mobile phones have on friendship?",
        answer: "Phones have had mixed effects on friendships. On the positive side, they make <u>staying connected incredibly easy</u>. You can maintain friendships across distances that would have faded in the past. Messaging apps let you share moments, thoughts, and support instantly. Group chats keep friend circles connected between meetups. You can easily coordinate plans and never lose touch with people who matter. Social media helps you remember birthdays and see what friends are up to. However, there are significant negatives too. Phone use when together can damage <u>present-moment connection</u>. We've all experienced trying to have a conversation with someone who keeps checking their phone. The quality of interaction suffers. Constant digital connection might reduce the feeling that physical meetups are necessary. Some people maintain many shallow connections rather than fewer deep friendships. There can be comparison and jealousy from seeing friends' curated highlights. <u>Miscommunication</u> happens easily in text without tone and facial cues. And there's the phenomenon of feeling lonely despite being constantly connected. The key is using phones to enhance friendships rather than substitute for real connection."

      {
        question: "Is it a waste of time to take pictures with mobile phones?",
        answer: "I don't think it's a waste of time in general, but it can become <u>problematic when excessive</u>. Photography has real value. Capturing memories allows us to revisit meaningful moments and share experiences with others. Looking through old photos can bring joy and strengthen bonds with people who were there. Documenting life has become easier and more democratic with phone cameras. However, there's a point where photographing everything actually <u>diminishes the experience</u>. If you're so focused on getting the perfect shot that you're not truly present, that's a problem. Some people spend entire concerts watching through their phone screens, which seems to miss the point. There's also the issue of never doing anything with the thousands of photos we take. They sit unseen in storage, which does seem wasteful. The <u>performative aspect</u> for social media can make photography more about showing others than genuine memory-keeping. I think the balance is taking some photos to capture special moments, then putting the phone away and actually experiencing things. A few meaningful photos are worth more than hundreds of thoughtless ones."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you think it is necessary to have laws on the use of mobile phones?",
        answer: "Yes, I believe some regulation is necessary, though it needs to be <u>carefully targeted</u>. The clearest case is phone use while driving, which is rightly illegal in most places because it's genuinely dangerous and puts others at risk. Evidence shows that distracted driving causes many accidents, so laws against it are justified. Beyond driving, things get more complex. <u>Privacy laws</u> around recording people without consent, taking photos in certain places, and sharing content are important. There should be protections against harassment and misuse of phones to harm others. In schools, policies restricting phone use during class time seem reasonable to support learning. For children, regulations on how apps can target and collect data from minors are increasingly important. However, I'm wary of <u>overly restrictive laws</u> that control how adults choose to use phones in their personal time. That starts feeling like overreach. The emphasis should be on situations where phone use creates genuine harm to others or to vulnerable groups. Education and social norms often work better than laws for encouraging responsible personal use."
      },
      {
        question: "What are examples of good and poor phone manners?",
        answer: "Good phone manners include <u>putting your phone away</u> during meals, conversations, and meetings to give others your full attention. Keeping your phone on silent or vibrate in public spaces and stepping away to take necessary calls rather than having loud conversations around others. Asking permission before photographing someone or posting pictures of them. Responding to messages in reasonable time without expecting instant replies from others. Being present at events rather than constantly filming. <u>Not checking your phone</u> when someone is speaking to you. Avoiding phone use in quiet places like libraries, theaters, or during ceremonies. Poor phone manners are essentially the opposite. Having loud conversations in public, leaving your ringer on full volume in quiet settings, constantly checking your phone when with others, walking while staring at your screen and blocking paths, taking flash photos where inappropriate, <u>scrolling during meals</u> or conversations, sharing others' information without permission, and expecting immediate responses at all hours. Many of these seem obvious, but we all slip up sometimes. Being mindful of how our phone use affects others is really the core of good phone etiquette."

    answer: `The famous person I'd most like to meet is David Attenborough. He's the legendary British naturalist and broadcaster who's been making nature documentaries for over sixty years.

I first became aware of him as a child watching his wildlife programs with my parents. His voice narrating footage of animals in remote corners of the world was <u>utterly captivating</u>. Over the years, I've watched practically everything he's made, from early programs to recent series about our oceans and planet.

Ideally, I'd love to meet him somewhere natural rather than a formal interview setting. Maybe a botanical garden or even a forest walk, somewhere he'd feel <u>comfortable and at home</u>. I imagine a relaxed conversation where I could ask him about his experiences and hear stories that never made it to screen.

The reason I want to meet him is partly because of what he's achieved. He's spent his entire life educating people about the natural world and has probably done more than anyone to make people care about wildlife and conservation. His <u>genuine passion and curiosity</u>, even at nearly a hundred years old, is incredibly inspiring.

But beyond his work, I'm curious about his perspective on life after such an extraordinary career. He's witnessed so many changes to our planet, both wonderful discoveries and <u>devastating losses</u>. I'd want to know what gives him hope, how he stays optimistic, and what advice he'd have for younger generations who care about these issues.

        question: "What are the advantages and disadvantages of being a famous child?",
        answer: "Being famous as a child comes with <u>significant trade-offs</u>. On the advantage side, there can be financial benefits and opportunities that most children never have access to. Child stars may earn substantial money for their families and themselves. They might get excellent education, travel, and experiences. Being good at something and receiving recognition can build confidence. They develop skills and professional experience early. However, the disadvantages are serious. <u>Normal childhood</u> is often sacrificed. Famous children miss regular school experiences, friendships, and the freedom to be anonymous and make mistakes privately. There's enormous pressure to perform and maintain fame. Media scrutiny and public criticism can be damaging to developing self-esteem. Some face exploitation by adults around them, including sometimes their own families. Education may suffer as work takes priority. When fame fades, which often happens, adjustment can be extremely difficult. Many former child stars have spoken about <u>psychological struggles</u> and feeling they missed their youth. Overall, I think the disadvantages often outweigh the advantages, which is why many parents choose to protect their talented children from early fame."
      },
      {
        question: "What can today's children do to become famous?",
        answer: "The pathways to fame have <u>multiplied dramatically</u> for today's children compared to previous generations. Social media platforms offer direct routes that didn't exist before. Children can build audiences through YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram by creating content around their talents or personalities, whether that's singing, dancing, comedy, gaming, or just being entertaining. Traditional routes still exist too. Talent competitions on television, child acting auditions, sports development programs, and junior competitions in various fields can all lead to recognition. Some children become famous through <u>viral moments</u>, which can happen accidentally without any planning. Academic or scientific achievement at a young age, like winning major competitions or making discoveries, brings a different kind of fame. Child activists like Greta Thunberg have shown that championing causes can create platforms. Having famous parents gives some children a significant head start, though they still need to develop their own appeal. However, I'd caution that <u>pursuing fame</u> as a goal is probably not healthy for children. It's better to focus on developing genuine skills and passions, and if recognition follows, that's a bonus."

        question: "What can children do with their fame?",
        answer: "Famous children have several options for using their platforms. Many use fame to build <u>careers in their field</u>. Child actors continue acting, young musicians develop their craft, and athletes progress through development systems. Their early recognition provides opportunities, connections, and resources to keep advancing. Some use their fame to <u>advocate for causes</u> they care about. Young voices can be particularly powerful for issues affecting children or future generations, like education, environment, or health. Famous children can raise awareness and funds in ways ordinary children cannot. There are commercial opportunities too. Endorsements, merchandise, and business ventures can turn fame into financial security, though this needs careful management. Some famous children choose to <u>step back from public life</u> to focus on normal development, using their earlier success as a foundation for later opportunities without constant spotlight. Education should remain a priority because fame is often temporary, especially for children. The smart ones prepare for multiple futures. Whatever path they choose, having adult guidance that prioritizes the child's wellbeing over exploitation is crucial."

        question: "Do people become famous because of their talent?",
        answer: "Talent is certainly <u>one pathway to fame</u>, but it's far from the only one, and it's not always sufficient. Many genuinely talented people never achieve fame because they lack opportunity, connections, or luck. Meanwhile, some famous people have modest talents but excel at self-promotion or benefit from circumstances. Fame can come from many sources beyond talent. Being born into a famous family provides immediate recognition. Wealth can buy visibility and opportunities. <u>Controversy or scandal</u> makes people famous, sometimes unwillingly. Viral moments can create temporary fame regardless of talent. Being in the right place at the right time matters enormously. That said, sustained fame usually requires something more substantial. Even people who become famous through luck or circumstance typically need to develop skills to maintain relevance. In competitive fields like sports, music, or acting, talent combined with hard work is usually necessary for lasting success. The most respected forms of fame generally do involve <u>genuine achievement</u>. So while talent alone doesn't guarantee fame, and fame doesn't always indicate talent, there is correlation, especially over the long term."
      },
      {
        question: "Is it easy to become famous in your country?",
        answer: "It depends on what kind of fame we're talking about. Becoming <u>momentarily famous</u> through viral content or social media is probably easier than ever before. Anyone with a phone can potentially create something that millions see. However, this kind of fame is usually fleeting and doesn't necessarily translate into lasting recognition or career success. Becoming famous in traditional ways, like being a successful actor, musician, athlete, or business leader, remains very difficult. There's intense competition, and only a tiny percentage of people pursuing these paths achieve real fame. Having connections, resources, and access to opportunities definitely helps, which means it's <u>easier for some</u> than others. The entertainment industry in my country is quite developed, which creates opportunities but also means more competition. Geographic location within the country matters too. Being in major cities with media industries offers more chances. Overall, I'd say becoming temporarily noticed is easy, becoming properly famous is hard, and <u>staying famous</u> while having a sustainable career is hardest of all. Most people who try to become famous don't succeed, regardless of their talent or effort."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you want to be a famous person?",
        answer: "Honestly, I have mixed feelings about this. There are aspects of fame that seem appealing. Having a platform to share ideas or make a positive impact, being recognized for achievements, and the opportunities that fame provides are attractive in theory. The financial rewards can be significant too. However, when I really think about it, I don't think I'd want actual fame. The <u>loss of privacy</u> seems like a huge cost. Famous people can't go about their daily lives normally. They're recognized, photographed, and judged constantly. Every mistake becomes public. Social media means facing criticism and even harassment from strangers. Relationships become complicated when you can't be sure of people's motives. The pressure to maintain a public image seems exhausting. I value being able to walk down the street unnoticed, make mistakes privately, and have <u>genuine connections</u> with people who know the real me rather than a public persona. I'd be happy with success and respect in my field without the broader fame that comes with being a public figure. Perhaps the best version would be being respected by people whose opinions matter to me, without being widely known to the general public."

    answer: `The job I'd really love to have in the future is working as a user experience designer for a tech company, ideally one that creates products that help people in meaningful ways.

I first became aware of this field about three years ago when I was frustrated with a banking app that was <u>impossible to navigate</u>. I started researching why some apps are intuitive while others are nightmares, and I discovered this whole world of UX design. I began following designers on social media, reading their case studies, and the more I learned, the more I realized this is what I want to do.

To get this job, I'd need to develop several skills. Obviously I'd need to master design software like Figma and learn the principles of <u>human-centered design</u>. I'd also need to understand user research methods, how to conduct interviews, usability testing, and interpret data. Some coding knowledge would help too, at least enough to communicate effectively with developers. I'm currently taking online courses and building a portfolio of personal projects to develop these skills.

What makes this job perfect for me is that it combines creativity with problem-solving in a way that <u>directly impacts people's lives</u>. I love the idea of making technology more accessible and enjoyable for everyone. It's also a field where you're constantly learning because technology keeps evolving. The work environment tends to be collaborative and creative, which suits my personality. And honestly, the job market for UX designers is strong, so it offers good career stability and growth potential. It just feels like the right fit for my interests and strengths.`,

        question: "What kind of job can be called a 'dream job'?",
        answer: "A dream job means different things to different people, but there are some common elements. For most, it's work that <u>aligns with their passions</u> and interests, something they'd enjoy doing even without pay. It typically offers a sense of purpose and meaning, feeling like you're contributing something valuable. Financial reward matters too because a job that can't support your lifestyle creates stress regardless of how interesting it is. Good dream jobs usually offer <u>growth and learning opportunities</u> rather than becoming stagnant. Work-life balance is increasingly important, with flexibility and reasonable hours. The work environment and colleagues matter because even interesting work becomes miserable with toxic culture. For some, a dream job involves creativity and autonomy, while others dream of stable, predictable work with clear expectations. Some want high status and recognition, others prefer working quietly behind the scenes. There's also the rare category of jobs that seem universally dreamy, like getting paid to travel, taste food, or play games. Ultimately, a dream job is highly <u>personal and subjective</u>, matching an individual's unique combination of values, skills, and circumstances."

      {
        question: "What jobs do children want to do when they grow up?",
        answer: "Children's job aspirations tend to follow certain patterns. Very young children often gravitate toward <u>visible, heroic professions</u> like firefighter, police officer, doctor, or astronaut. These jobs are easy to understand, frequently appear in media, and involve helping people or exciting activities. Many children dream of being professional athletes, especially in whatever sport is popular in their culture. Entertainment careers like singer, actor, or YouTuber are incredibly common now due to <u>media influence</u>. Animals inspire many children to want to become vets or zookeepers. Creative professions like artist or author appeal to imaginative children. Some children are influenced by their parents' jobs or people they know personally. Boys and girls historically showed different patterns, though this is changing. What's interesting is that children rarely dream of becoming accountants, middle managers, or other common adult jobs because these are <u>abstract and invisible</u> to them. Their dreams reflect what they're exposed to and what seems exciting from their limited perspective. As they grow and learn more about the world, these dreams typically evolve and become more realistic."
      },
      {
        question: "Do people's ideal jobs change as they grow up?",
        answer: "Absolutely, most people's career aspirations <u>evolve significantly</u> over time. The childhood dreams we discussed are usually replaced by more realistic goals as we learn about the world and ourselves. Teenagers start considering their actual abilities and academic performance, which rules out some options and opens others. Exposure to different subjects in school might spark new interests. By university or early adulthood, people have usually narrowed their focus considerably based on their education choices. Early work experiences then <u>shape expectations further</u>. Someone might realize an idealized job isn't what they expected in practice. Life circumstances also force changes. Financial pressures might push people toward practical rather than dream careers. Family responsibilities can change priorities, with stability becoming more important than passion. Some people discover new passions later in life that redirect their path. Economic changes create and destroy industries, making some dream jobs obsolete while creating new possibilities. I think very few people end up in the exact job they imagined as children, but hopefully they find something that suits who they've become, even if it's <u>different from early dreams</u>."

        question: "What should people consider when choosing jobs?",
        answer: "There are many factors to weigh when making career decisions. <u>Personal interest and aptitude</u> should be foundational. You'll spend a huge portion of your life working, so choosing something you genuinely enjoy and are reasonably good at matters enormously. Financial considerations are practical necessities, including salary, benefits, and long-term earning potential relative to your living costs and goals. <u>Job security and market demand</u> for the role affect stability. Growth opportunities within the field determine whether you can progress or will become stuck. Work-life balance, working hours, stress levels, and flexibility impact quality of life significantly. The work environment, company culture, and types of colleagues you'd have affect daily happiness. Location requirements matter because some jobs demand relocation or commuting. Alignment with personal values is increasingly important to many people. Required education and training represent investments of time and money that should factor into decisions. <u>Physical and mental demands</u> should be realistic for your circumstances. And honestly, some consideration of what you'd regret not trying is valuable. It's impossible to optimize all factors, so individuals must prioritize based on what matters most to them personally."

      {
        question: "Is salary the main reason why people choose a certain job?",
        answer: "Salary is certainly an important factor, but I don't think it's the main reason for most people. Research consistently shows that beyond a certain income level that covers basic needs and some comfort, additional money has <u>diminishing effects on happiness</u>. People often accept lower-paying jobs because of better work-life balance, more interesting work, nicer colleagues, or alignment with their values. Many teachers, nurses, artists, and nonprofit workers deliberately choose less lucrative paths because of passion or purpose. That said, salary can't be dismissed. For people struggling financially or supporting families, earning potential might indeed be the <u>primary consideration</u>. Early in careers, higher starting salaries compound significantly over time, so they're strategically important. Salary also serves as recognition and validation for many people. And honestly, in societies that emphasize material success, high salaries carry status that matters to some. I think the healthiest approach is considering salary as one important factor among many rather than the <u>sole criterion</u>. A high-paying job you hate is often worse than a reasonably-paying job you enjoy, but a passion job that can't pay rent isn't sustainable either. Balance is key."

        question: "What kind of jobs are the most popular in your country?",
        answer: "The popularity of jobs varies depending on whether we mean common jobs or desirable jobs. In terms of <u>sheer numbers</u>, service industry jobs in retail, hospitality, and food service employ huge numbers of people. Office and administrative work is very common. Healthcare workers including nurses and care assistants make up a significant portion. Teachers and education workers are numerous. In terms of what people <u>aspire to</u>, that's different. Technology jobs are extremely popular aspirations now because of good salaries and perceived exciting work. Business and finance careers remain attractive for earning potential. Medicine and law maintain prestige despite demanding training. Government jobs appeal for stability and benefits. Creative industries like media, design, and entertainment attract many despite being competitive. What's considered <u>prestigious or desirable</u> shifts with generations. Younger people often value flexibility and purpose more than previous generations who prioritized stability. The pandemic changed attitudes too, with some previously overlooked essential workers gaining recognition while remote-work possibilities changed what jobs seem attractive. Regional differences within my country also exist, with different industries dominating different areas."

    ],
    answer: `One moment that made me incredibly proud was when my younger sister graduated from university last year. It was a sunny day in June, and our whole family was there in the audience.

My sister is five years younger than me. She's always been <u>determined and hardworking</u>, but her journey through university wasn't easy at all. She had to work part-time throughout her degree to help pay for her studies, sometimes doing twenty hours a week on top of her coursework.

What made me especially proud was that despite all these challenges, she graduated with honours in her engineering degree. She was one of only a handful of women in her program, and she didn't just survive, she <u>thrived</u>. She also did a year-long internship at a great company and received a job offer before she even graduated.

When they called her name and she walked across that stage to receive her diploma, I honestly got quite emotional. I felt proud because I knew how hard she'd worked and how many obstacles she'd overcome. There were times during her studies when she was <u>exhausted and doubted herself</u>, and I'd try to encourage her. Seeing her succeed felt like validation that all that effort was worth it.

I was also proud because she achieved something that no one in our immediate family had done before. She's the first person in our family to get an engineering degree. It felt like she was <u>opening doors</u> not just for herself but setting an example for our younger cousins. That day reminded me how proud I am to be her older sibling.`,

        question: "When would parents feel proud of their children?",
        answer: "Parents feel proud of their children in various situations. Academic achievements are common triggers, whether it's good grades, awards, graduations, or getting into desired schools. <u>Seeing hard work pay off</u> is particularly satisfying for parents who've witnessed the effort. Talent displays in sports, music, art, or other activities bring pride, especially during performances or competitions. But I think the deeper pride often comes from character moments. When a child shows kindness, helps others, stands up for what's right, or handles difficulties with maturity, parents feel proud of who their child is becoming. <u>Milestones and firsts</u> bring pride, from first steps to first jobs. When children become independent and self-sufficient, parents feel their job was done well. Overcoming challenges, whether health issues, learning difficulties, or personal struggles, generates intense pride. Sometimes parents feel proud when children pursue their own paths even against expectations, showing courage and authenticity. And eventually, parents feel proud when their adult children become good partners, parents themselves, or <u>contributing members of society</u>. Pride spans from small daily moments to major life achievements."
      },
      {
        question: "Should parents reward children? Why and how?",
        answer: "I think rewards can be useful tools in parenting, but they need to be used thoughtfully. Rewards can <u>motivate children</u> to try new things, persist through challenges, and develop good habits. They provide clear feedback that certain behaviors are valued. For younger children especially, rewards make abstract concepts like good behavior more concrete and understandable. However, how you reward matters enormously. I think <u>praise and recognition</u> are often more valuable than material rewards. Acknowledging effort, not just results, teaches children that hard work matters. Experiences like special outings or activities can be better rewards than toys because they create memories and don't accumulate clutter. Any material rewards should be proportionate to the achievement. The timing matters too because immediate rewards are more effective than delayed ones for young children. It's also important to explain why you're rewarding so children understand what behavior is being encouraged. And rewards should gradually <u>fade as intrinsic motivation develops</u>. The goal is children who do the right thing because it's right, not just for rewards."
      },
      {
        question: "Is it good to reward children too often? Why?",
        answer: "No, I don't think rewarding too frequently is beneficial, and research supports this. When rewards are given too often or for too little, several problems arise. First, children can become <u>dependent on external validation</u> and struggle to find internal motivation. They start asking what's in it for me before doing anything. Second, frequent rewards lose their power. What was once special becomes expected, and children need bigger rewards to feel motivated, creating an <u>escalating cycle</u>. Third, rewarding every small thing devalues actual achievements. If you get a reward for everything, nothing feels particularly worth celebrating. Fourth, it can create transactional relationships where children only behave well for rewards, not because of genuine values. Fifth, too many material rewards can foster <u>materialism and entitlement</u>. Children should learn that effort is its own reward and that not everything deserves a prize. I think the better approach is reserving rewards for genuine achievements and extra effort, while using simple acknowledgment and verbal praise for everyday expectations. This maintains the <u>meaning and motivation value</u> of rewards while developing intrinsic motivation."

      {
        question: "On what occasions would adults be proud of themselves?",
        answer: "Adults feel proud of themselves in many situations. <u>Career achievements</u> like promotions, completing major projects, recognition from colleagues, or reaching professional goals bring pride. Overcoming personal challenges, whether health issues, bad habits, fears, or difficult circumstances, generates deep self-pride. Learning new skills or knowledge, especially later in life when learning feels harder, is satisfying. <u>Personal growth</u> moments like handling situations better than you would have previously, showing restraint, or making difficult right choices create quiet pride. Financial milestones like paying off debt, buying a home, or achieving stability bring pride in self-sufficiency. Relationship accomplishments like maintaining long friendships, having a good marriage, or resolving conflicts well matter. For parents, seeing their children succeed and knowing they contributed brings reflected pride. <u>Creative accomplishments</u> like finishing a project, performing, or making something meaningful satisfy deeply. Helping others in significant ways, whether through work, volunteering, or personal support, creates pride. Even maintaining good habits like fitness, healthy lifestyle, or consistent routines generates daily self-pride. Adults often find pride in smaller things than they expected when younger, valuing <u>consistency and integrity</u> over dramatic achievements."
      },
      {
        question: "Do rewards help a child become better?",
        answer: "Rewards can help children improve, but they're not a guaranteed solution and work differently depending on the situation. For <u>developing new skills</u> or establishing habits, appropriate rewards can provide motivation during the difficult early stages when intrinsic satisfaction isn't yet present. They can make learning feel like a game rather than a chore. For behaviors that children don't naturally enjoy, rewards can bridge the gap. However, rewards work best when combined with other approaches. Teaching why something matters, providing supportive environments, being good role models, and <u>developing intrinsic motivation</u> are equally important. Rewards alone, without these elements, often fail long-term. The type of reward matters too. Praise, recognition, and special privileges often work better than material items for building lasting improvement. And rewards must be paired with <u>clear expectations and consistency</u>. Random or unclear reward systems confuse children. There's also evidence that for tasks children already enjoy, adding external rewards can actually reduce intrinsic motivation, making them worse. So rewards are one useful tool among many, not a complete solution for helping children improve."
      },
      {
        question: "What do you think about children working hard just for grades?",
        answer: "I have concerns about this approach to education. While grades can be useful <u>indicators of learning</u> and motivators for effort, focusing solely on grades creates several problems. First, it prioritizes performance over actual learning. Children might memorize for tests and forget everything afterward, or choose easy options to protect grades rather than challenging themselves. Second, it creates <u>unhealthy stress and anxiety</u>. Children obsessed with grades often suffer mentally, and the pressure can become overwhelming. Third, it narrows their development. Education should develop curiosity, creativity, social skills, and character, not just test performance. Fourth, it doesn't prepare them well for real life, where grades stop mattering and actual skills and abilities take over. Fifth, it can lead to <u>cheating and shortcuts</u> because the goal becomes the grade rather than the knowledge. That said, I understand why children focus on grades given our education systems and competitive environments. Parents, schools, and universities all emphasize grades. So while I think it's problematic, children are responding rationally to the incentives they face. The system needs to change to value <u>genuine learning and holistic development</u> more than grades alone."
